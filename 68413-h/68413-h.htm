<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>JACK WANTS A DOLLAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Professor</span>, will you please give me a dollar?”
asked Jack Allen, of the elderly man who sat reading
a book in the library.</p>

<p>“A dollar, Jack?” and Professor Simonedes
Klopper, who had retired from the position of
mathematical instructor in a large college, to devote
his declining years to study, looked over the
rims of his big glasses at the boy before him. “A
dollar? Why, what in the world do you want of a
dollar, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I—I want to go to a show,” and Jack rather
hesitated for he was doubtful over the outcome of
his request.</p>

<p>“A show?” and the professor’s eyes opened so
wide that, seen through the powerful lenses of his
glasses, they reminded Jack of the orbs of a cuttlefish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“Yes, professor. There’s going to be a show
in town to-night, and I’d like to go. All the boys
will be there.”</p>

<p>“Does it cost a dollar to go to a—er—a performance?”</p>

<p>“No; not exactly. The tickets are fifty cents,
but I wanted a little extra to treat some of my
chums with.”</p>

<p>“Treat? Ah, yes, I presume you mean to furnish
some sort of refreshment for your youthful
companions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Can I have the money? I haven’t
drawn all my allowance this month.”</p>

<p>“No; you are correct there. There is still a
balance of two dollars and thirteen cents in your
allowance account for this month, computing the
interest at six per cent. But I shall not give you
the dollar.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Because I don’t choose to.”</p>

<p>“My father would, if he was here.”</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t here, and I’m in charge of you,
and the money your parents left for your care and
support while they are away. I most certainly
shall not give you a dollar to waste on any such
foolishness as what you term a ‘show’ by which I
apprehend that you mean a performance of some
character.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“It’s a vaudeville show,” went on Jack. “It’s
real funny.”</p>

<p>“Funny!” ejaculated the professor with a snort.
“Fun is a very poor substitute for knowledge,
young man. If you have an evening to spare you
should spend it on your books. You are very backward
in your Latin and mathematics. When I
was your age I used to devote my entire evening
to working out problems in algebra or geometry.”</p>

<p>“Will you give me fifty cents?” asked Jack
desperately, not wishing to let the professor get
too deep into the matter of study.</p>

<p>“Fifty cents? What for?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can go to the show for that, but I
wanted some to treat the boys with. They’ve
bought sodas for me several times, now, and I
want to pay them back.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That is all the rising generation
thinks of! Having a good time, and eating! No,
Jack, I shall not give you a dollar for any such
purpose. And I will not give you fifty cents. Do
you know that one dollar, put out at six per cent,
will, if the interest be compounded, amount in one
hundred years, to three hundred and forty dollars?
Think of it! Three hundred and forty dollars!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t expect to live a hundred years,
professor. Besides, it’s my money,” spoke Jack,
with just the least bit of defiance in his tone.</p>

<p>“It is, to a certain extent,” answered the crusty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
old professor, “but I am the treasurer and your
guardian. I shall certainly not permit you to
waste your substance in riotous living.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call it riotous living to go to a vaudeville
show once in a while, and buy an ice cream
soda,” retorted Jack.</p>

<p>“You know nothing about it; nothing whatever.
Now if you had asked me for a dollar, to buy some
book, that would impart to you useful knowledge,
I would have complied at once. More than this,
I would have helped you select the book. I have
a list of several good ones, that can be purchased
for a dollar.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any books,” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>“You shall have no dollar to spend foolishly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s foolish,” insisted Jack.
“Look here, professor, I’ve been studying hard,
lately. I haven’t had any fun in a good while.
This is the first chance I’ve had to go to a show,
and I think you might let me go. Dad would if
he was here.”</p>

<p>“You shall not go. I think I know what is best
for you.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m going anyhow!” burst out Jack.
“I’m not going to stay shut up in the house all the
while! I want a little recreation. If you don’t
give me the dollar, I’ll——”</p>

<p>“What will you do?” asked the professor
quickly, shutting his book, and standing up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
“Don’t you dare to threaten me, young man!
What will you do if I don’t give you the dollar?
I shall write to your father. The postal authorities
must have located him and your mother by
this time, even if they are in China.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you had any word yet?” asked Jack,
a new turn being given to his thoughts.</p>

<p>“No; and it is very strange. All trace of them
seems to be lost after they left Hong Kong, but
the letters will finally reach them. I shall inform
Mr. Allen of your conduct.”</p>

<p>“I think he’d say I was right,” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>“That would make no difference to me,” declared
the professor. “I know my duty and I am
going to do it. But you have not answered my
question. What did you threaten to do if I did
not give you the dollar?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t threaten anything.”</p>

<p>“You were going to.”</p>

<p>“I was going to say if you didn’t give me the
dollar I’d go to the show anyhow.”</p>

<p>“How can you go if you have no money?”</p>

<p>“I’ll find a way. Please, Professor Klopper,
advance me a dollar from my allowance that dad
left with you for me.”</p>

<p>“Not one penny for such a frivolous use as
that,” replied the professor firmly. “Now let me
hear no more about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going!” fired back Jack. “I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
bound to see that show, and have a good time once
in a while.”</p>

<p>“That will do!” cried the professor so sharply
that Jack was startled. “Go to your room at
once. I will deal with you later. I never inflict
any punishment when I am angry, and you have
very nearly made me so. I will attend to your case
later. Go to your room at once!”</p>

<p>There was no choice but to obey. Slowly Jack
left the library, and mounted the stairs to his own
apartment. His heart was bitter, and he was not
a little worried concerning his father and mother,
for, since Mr. and Mrs. Sylvester Allen had
reached China, on their trip around the world,
news had been received that there had been serious
uprisings against the “foreign devils” as the Mongolians
call people not of their race.</p>

<p>Jack Allen, who was a bright, sturdy youth, of
about sixteen years, lived in the town of Westville,
in one of our Eastern States. He was an only
child, and his parents were well off.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen was very fond of travel, and so was
his wife, but they had had little chance to gratify
their tastes. A short time before this story opens
Mr. Allen’s firm had some business to transact
abroad, in several countries. Mr. Allen was
offered the chance to go, and, as it was a long-awaited
opportunity he decided to take his wife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
and, while they were about it, make a tour of the
world.</p>

<p>Jack begged hard to be allowed to go, but, as
it would have broken up his schooling, and as his
father wanted him to become an electrical engineer,
he was, much against his will, left at home.</p>

<p>Jack attended the Westville Academy, and was
one of the best students in that institution. When
his parents decided to make their long trip, they
discussed several plans of having their son taken
care of while they were away. Finally they decided
to send him to live with a former college
instructor, Professor Klopper, who was an eminent
authority on many subjects.</p>

<p>The professor was a bachelor, and, with an
elderly sister, lived in a somewhat gloomy house
on the outskirts of Westville.</p>

<p>There Jack had been for about a year, attending
school in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>He had never liked Professor Klopper, for the
aged man was crabbed and dictatorial, and very
stern when it came to lessons. He made Jack
study more than any other boy who went to the
academy, and was continually examining him at
home, on what he had learned in school. This,
undoubtedly, was good for Jack’s scholarship, but
the boy did not like it.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen had arranged that the professor
should have complete charge of Jack, and a goodly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
sum had been left with the scientist for the keep
of the boy.</p>

<p>“Give him a little spending money,” Mr. Allen
had said to the professor, “and see that he does
not waste it.”</p>

<p>The trouble was that the mathematical mind of
the professor and the more liberal one of Jack’s
father differed as to what a “little spending
money” was, and what was meant by “wasting” it.</p>

<p>The consequence was that Jack led a very miserable
life with the professor, but he was too manly
a lad to complain, so his letters to his parents said
nothing about the disagreeable side of his sojourn
with the former college teacher.</p>

<p>But, of late, there had come no letters from Mr.
and Mrs. Allen. Jack’s boyish epistles had not
been replied to, and the professor’s long effusions,
containing precise reports as to his ward’s
progress, were not answered.</p>

<p>All trace of Mr. and Mrs. Allen was lost when
they got to China, though up to now Jack had not
worried about them, as he realized that mail in
some foreign countries is not as certain as it is in
the United States.</p>

<p>“Professor Klopper is the meanest old codger
that ever lived!” exclaimed Jack, as he mounted
the stairs to his room. “I wish dad and mother
would come back. It’s been a long time since I’ve
seen them, and things are getting worse here instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
of better. The idea of not giving me a
dollar!</p>

<p>“All the fellows are saying sneering things
about me, too,” he went on, “because I don’t treat
oftener. How can I treat when I don’t get any
money? I’ve a good notion to write to dad, and
tell him about it. If I only knew his exact address
I would, but I’ll have to ask old Klopper,
and then he’ll catch on. No, I suppose I’ve got
to stand it. But I wish I could see that show to-night.
I wonder if I couldn’t raise the money
somehow? I might borrow it—no, that wouldn’t
do. I don’t know when I could pay it back. If I
had something I could sell——”</p>

<p>He thought a moment, and then an idea came
to him.</p>

<p>“My catching glove!” he exclaimed. “It’s a
good one yet, and Tom Berwick will give me a
dollar for it. If I play shortstop this summer
I’ll not need it. I’ll sell that.”</p>

<p>Jack, who had been rather downhearted, felt
better after he had reached this decision. He began
rummaging in a closet that contained various
articles, more or less intimately connected with
boyish sports, and presently withdrew a large,
padded catching glove.</p>

<p>“It cost seven dollars, just before dad went
away,” he remarked. “It’s worth three now, but
I’ll let Tom have it for a dollar. That will give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
me enough to go to the show and treat the crowd
I owe sodas to. I’ll do it. I’ll go to the show,
no matter what Klopper says. But I’ve got to
sneak out, for if he sees me he’ll stop me. Most
likely he’ll be reading in the library this evening.”</p>

<p>Jack knew his temporary guardian would not
make him remain in his room without supper, for
the professor was not needlessly cruel. As the
June afternoon was drawing to a close, Miss
Klopper, the professor’s sister, came to Jack’s
door.</p>

<p>“Here is your supper,” she said, handing in a
tray, none too well filled. “My brother says you
are to remain in your room until to-morrow morning,
when he hopes you will have repented. I
hope you will, too. Boys are such perverse
creatures.”</p>

<p>Jack said nothing. He took the tray, for he
was very hungry. But he did not intend to remain
in his room all that evening, when there was
a vaudeville show in town.</p>

<p>“It won’t be the first time I’ve gotten out of
the window,” thought Jack, when Miss Klopper
had closed the door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>AT THE SHOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> knew there was little fear of detection,
for, on several other occasions, when he had been
denied the privilege of going out on an evening,
he had climbed from the window of his room, out
on the roof of a low shed, and, by means of the
lightning rod, to the ground. He intended doing
it this time.</p>

<p>He finished his supper, and wished it had been
larger. But he consoled himself with the reflection
that he could fill the void in his stomach later
with an ice cream soda.</p>

<p>“Now to get out,” said Jack, as he went to the
door and listened, to see if the professor or his
sister was about. He heard nothing.</p>

<p>It was a small matter for the boy to get out
of the window. He had wrapped the big catching
glove up in a paper, and he dropped it out of the
casement, so that he might have both hands free
with which to climb down.</p>

<p>“So far, so good,” he murmured, as he picked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
up the glove, and started down a rear path to get
beyond the house, when he would strike out for
the village. But, just as he thought he was safe,
he heard some one moving on the other side of a
large lilac bush, and, before he could get out of
the way, he was confronted by Miss Klopper.
She had been out to feed a late supper to a hen
and some little chickens in the lower part of the
garden.</p>

<p>“Does my brother know you have left your
room?” asked the lady of the house.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>That was truthful enough, for Mr. Klopper had
a habit of sneaking up to Jack’s room, to look
through the keyhole, on such occasions as he sent
the lad to his apartment for punishment, and the
crabbed old man might, even now, have discovered
the absence of his ward.</p>

<p>“Didn’t he tell you to stay in your room?” went
on Miss Klopper.</p>

<p>“He did, but I don’t want to. It’s too nice out,”
and Jack took in deep breaths of the air, laden
with the sweet scent of roses.</p>

<p>“You must go back at once,” went on the
spinster.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to,” replied Jack. “I’m going
to have a good time for once in my life.”</p>

<p>“I shall tell my brother of your insubordinate
conduct.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“I don’t care,” fired back Jack, as he hurried
on.</p>

<p>“What have you in that bundle?” demanded
Miss Klopper, as she saw the package the youth
carried.</p>

<p>“Something of my own.”</p>

<p>“I demand to know what it is!”</p>

<p>“And I’m not going to tell you. It’s mine, and
I have a perfect right to do as I please with my
own things. Suffering cats!” exclaimed Jack
softly. “I wish dad and mom was home,” and,
not caring to have any further discussion with Miss
Klopper, he passed on, before she would have a
chance to summon the professor.</p>

<p>Jack was a good boy at heart, and he never
would do a mean act, but the professor and his
sister had treated him so harshly, though perhaps
they did not appreciate it, that his spirit rose in
rebellion.</p>

<p>Life at the professor’s house was becoming intolerable
for Jack. How he wished his parents
would come home. Yet it seemed now, with no
news arriving from them, that it would be several
months more before he could hope to be released
from the guardianship of Mr. Klopper.</p>

<p>Jack made all haste to the town, from which
the professor’s house was distant about a mile.
He wanted to find Tom, and dispose of the glove
in time to see the show from the start. He knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Tom would buy the mitt, for he had often expressed
a wish to purchase it, and Tom usually
had plenty of spending money.</p>

<p>Passing through the village streets Jack met
several boys he knew.</p>

<p>“Going to the show?” was the question nearly
every one of them asked of him.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he replied, as though he had several
dollars in his pockets, with which to buy tickets.
“I’ll meet you there. Seen Tom Berwick?” he
went on.</p>

<p>“Yep. He’s down in Newton’s drug store buying
sodas.”</p>

<p>Jack turned his steps thither, and met Tom coming
from the place. Tom was wiping his mouth
in a suggestive manner.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you see me a minute sooner?” he
asked. “I’d have bought you a soda,” for Tom
was a most generous lad.</p>

<p>“Wish you had,” replied Jack. “Say, Tom,
want to buy my catching glove?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with it?” asked Tom
quickly, for he had several times before offered to
purchase the big mitt, only to be met with a refusal.
“Ain’t it any good?”</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s good!”</p>

<p>“Then what you want to sell for?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to play short this season, and
I don’t need a catching glove. It’s a dandy. Look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
at it,” and Jack handed it to Tom, having taken
off the paper wrapping when he was out of sight
of the professor’s house.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” acknowledged Tom, after a
critical inspection. “How much?”</p>

<p>“Give me two dollars?”</p>

<p>Jack had his own ideas about finance.</p>

<p>“Go on. I will not.”</p>

<p>“It cost seven.”</p>

<p>“Yes; two seasons ago. I can get a new one
for three dollars.”</p>

<p>“Not like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe not, but good enough.”</p>

<p>“I’ll let you have it for a dollar and a half,”
went on Jack. “That’s cheap enough.”</p>

<p>“Give you a dollar,” replied Tom quickly, who
knew how to bargain.</p>

<p>“All right,” and Jack sighed a little. He had
hoped to get enough to put aside some cash for
future emergencies.</p>

<p>Tom passed over the dollar. Then he tried on
the glove. It certainly was a good one.</p>

<p>“Come on in and I’ll treat you to a soda,” he
proposed generously, for he decided that he had
obtained a bargain, and could afford to treat.</p>

<p>“Going to the show?” asked Tom, as the two
came out of the drug store.</p>

<p>“Sure. That’s what I sold the glove for.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“What’s the matter? Don’t your dad send you
any money?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he left some for me, but it’s like pulling
teeth to get it from old Klopper. He wouldn’t
give me even fifty cents to-night, and he sent me
to my room. But I sneaked out, and I’m going
to have some fun.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk! He’s a regular hard-shell,
ain’t he?”</p>

<p>“I should say yes! But come on, or maybe we
won’t get a good seat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I got my ticket,” replied Tom. “Besides,
I want to take this glove home. I’ll see you
there.”</p>

<p>Jack hastened to the town auditorium, where,
occasionally, traveling theatrical shows played a
one-night stand. There was quite a throng in
front of the box office, and Jack was afraid he
would not get a seat, but he managed to secure
one well down in front.</p>

<p>The auditorium began to fill up rapidly. Jack
saw many of his chums, and nodded to them.
Then he began to study the program. An announcement
on it caught his eye. It was to the
effect that during the entertainment a chance would
be given to any amateur performers in the
audience to come upon the stage, and show what
they could do in the way of singing, dancing or
in other lines of public entertaining. Prizes would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
be given for the best act, it was stated; five dollars
for the first, three for the second, and one
for the third.</p>

<p>“Say,” Jack whispered to Tom, who came in
just then, “going to try for any of those prizes?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” replied Tom, vigorously chewing gum.
“I can’t do nothin’. Some of the fellows are,
though. Arthur Little is going to recite, and Sam
Parsons is going to do some contortions. Why,
do you want to try?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to.”</p>

<p>“What can you do?”</p>

<p>“My clown act,” replied Tom. “I’ve got some
new dancing steps, and maybe I could win a
prize.”</p>

<p>“Sure you could,” replied Tom generously.
“Go ahead. I’ll clap real loud for you.”</p>

<p>“Guess I will,” said Jack, breathing a little
faster under the exciting thought of appearing on
a real stage. He had often taken the part of a
clown in shows the boys arranged among themselves,
but this would be different.</p>

<p>“Ah, there goes the curtain!” exclaimed Tom,
as the orchestra finished playing the introduction,
and there was a murmur all over the auditorium,
as the first number of the vaudeville performance
started.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>JACK IS PUNISHED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> show was a fairly good one, and Jack and
the other boys, as well as older persons in the
audience, enjoyed the various numbers, from the
singing and dancing, to a one-act sketch.</p>

<p>More than one was anxious, however, for the
time to come when the amateurs would be given
a chance. At length the manager came before the
curtain, and announced that those who wished
might try their talents on the audience.</p>

<p>Several of the boys began to call for this or that
chum, whom they knew could do some specialty.</p>

<p>“Give us that whistling stunt, Jimmy!” was one
cry.</p>

<p>“Hey, Sim; here’s a chance to show how far
you can jump!” cried another.</p>

<p>“Speak about the boy on the burning deck!”
suggested a third.</p>

<p>“Now we must have quietness,” declared the
manager. “Those who wish to perform may come
up here, give me their names, and I will announce
them in turn.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Several lads started for the stage, Jack included.
His chums called good-naturedly after him as he
walked up the aisle.</p>

<p>“I might as well have all the fun I can to-night,”
thought our hero. “When Professor Klopper
finds out what I’ve done, if he hasn’t already, he’ll
be as mad as two hornets.”</p>

<p>The boys, and one or two girls, who had stage
aspirations, crowded around the manager, eager
to give in their names.</p>

<p>“Now, one at a time, please,” advised the theatrical
man. “You’ll each be given a chance. I
may add,” he went on, turning to the audience,
“that the prizes will be awarded by a popular
vote, as manifested by applause. The performer
getting the most applause will be considered to
have won the five dollars, and so with the other
two prizes.”</p>

<p>The amateurs began. Some of them did very
well, while others only made laughing stocks of
themselves. One of the girls did remarkably well
in reciting a scene from Shakespeare.</p>

<p>At last it came Jack’s turn. He was a little
nervous as he faced the footlights, and saw such a
large crowd before him. A thousand eyes seemed
focused on him. But he calmed himself with the
thought that it was no worse than doing as he had
often done when taking part in shows that he and
his chums arranged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>While waiting for his turn Jack had made an
appeal to the property man of the auditorium,
whom he knew quite well. The man, on Jack’s
request, had provided the lad with some white and
red face paint, and Jack had hurriedly made up
as much like a clown as possible, using one of the
dressing-rooms back of the stage for this purpose.
So, when it came his turn to go out, his appearance
was greeted with a burst of applause. He
was the first amateur to “make-up.”</p>

<p>Jack was, naturally, a rather droll lad, and he
was quite nimble on his feet. He had once been
much impressed by what a clown did in a small
circus, and he had practiced on variations of that
entertainer’s act, until he had a rather queer mixture
of songs, jokes, nimble dancing and acrobatic
steps.</p>

<p>This he now essayed, with such good effect that
he soon had the audience laughing, and, once that
is accomplished, the rest is comparatively easy for
this class of work on the stage.</p>

<p>Jack did his best. He went through a lot of
queer evolutions, leaped and danced as if his feet
were on springs, and ended with an odd little verse
and a backward summersault, which brought him
considerable applause.</p>

<p>“Jack’ll get first prize,” remarked Tom Berwick
to his chums, when they had done applauding
their friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>But he did not. The performer after him, a
young lady, who had undoubted talent, by her
manner of singing comic songs, to the accompaniment
of the orchestra, was adjudged to have won
first prize. Jack got second, and he was almost
as well pleased, for the young lady, Miss Mab
Fordworth, was quite a friend of his.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Jack, as the manager handed
him the three dollars, “here is where I have spending
money for a week, anyhow. I won’t have to
see the boys turning up their noses because I don’t
treat.”</p>

<p>The amateur efforts closed the performance,
and, after Jack had washed off the white and red
paint, he joined his chums.</p>

<p>“Say, Jack,” remarked Tom, “I didn’t know
you could do as well as that.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t, either,” replied Jack. “It was easy
after I got my wind. But I was a bit frightened
at first.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be on the stage,” observed Tom,
with something of a sigh. “But I can’t do anything
except catch balls. I don’t s’pose that would
take; would it?”</p>

<p>“It might,” replied Jack good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Well, come on, let’s get some sodas,” proposed
Tom. “It was hot in there. I’ll stand
treat.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re always standing treat,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
spoke Jack, quickly. “I guess it’s my turn,
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Jack’s spending some of his prize money,” remarked
Charlie Andrews.</p>

<p>“It’s the first I have had to spend in quite a
while,” was his answer. “Old Klopper holds me
down as close as if he was a miser. I’ll be glad
when my dad comes back.”</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Somewhere in China. We can’t find out exactly.
I’m getting a bit worried.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he’s all right,” observed Charlie.
“But if you’re going to stand treat, come on; I’m
dry.”</p>

<p>The boys were soon enjoying the sodas, and
Jack was glad that he had the chance to play host,
for it galled him to have to accept the hospitality
of his chums, and not do his share. Now, thanks
to his abilities as a clown, he was able to repay
the favors.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I might as well go in the front
door as to crawl in the window,” thought Jack,
as he neared the professor’s house. “He knows
I’m out, for that old maid told him, and he’ll be
waiting for me. I’m in for a lecture, and the
sooner it’s over the better. Oh, dear, but I wish
dad and mom were home!”</p>

<p>“Well, young man, give an account of yourself,”
said the professor sharply, when Jack came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
in. Mr. Klopper could never forget that he had
been a teacher, and a severe one at that. His
manner always savored of the classroom, especially
when about to administer a rebuke.</p>

<p>“I went to the show,” said Jack shortly. “I
told you I was going.”</p>

<p>“In other words you defied and disobeyed me.”</p>

<p>“I felt that I had a right to go. I’m not a
baby.”</p>

<p>“That is no excuse. I shall report your conduct
to your parents. Now another matter.
Where did you get the money to go with?”</p>

<p>“I—I got it.”</p>

<p>“Evidently; but I asked you where. The idea
of wasting fifty cents for a silly show! Did you
stop to realize that fifty cents would pay the interest
on ten dollars for a year, at five per cent?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t stop to figure it out, professor.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Nor did you stop to think
that for fifty cents you might have bought some
useful book. And you did not stop to consider
that you were disobeying me. I shall attend to
your case. Do you still refuse to tell me where
you got that money?”</p>

<p>“I—I’d rather not.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I shall make some inquiries. You
may retire now. I never make up my mind when
I am the least bit angry, and I find myself somewhat
displeased with you at this moment.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Displeased” was a mild way of putting it, Jack
thought.</p>

<p>“I shall see you in the morning,” went on the
professor. “It is Saturday, and there is no school.
Remain in your room until I come up. I wish
to have a serious talk with you.”</p>

<p>Jack had no relish for this. It would not be the
first time the professor had had a “serious talk”
with him, for, of late, the old teacher was getting
more and more strict in his treatment of the boy.
Jack was sure his father would not approve of the
professor’s method. But Mr. Allen was far away,
and his son was not likely to see him for some
time.</p>

<p>But, in spite of what he knew was in store for
him the next morning, Jack slept well, for he was
a healthy youth.</p>

<p>“I suppose he’ll punish me in some way,” he
said, as he arose, “but he won’t dare do very much,
though he’s been pretty stiff of late.”</p>

<p>The professor was “pretty stiff” when he came
to Jack’s room to remonstrate with his ward on
what he had done. Jack never remembered such
a lecture as he got that day. Then the former
college instructor ended up with:</p>

<p>“And, as a punishment, you will keep to your
room to-day and to-morrow. I forbid you to stir
from it, and if I find you trying to sneak out, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
you did last night, I shall take stringent measures
to prevent you.”</p>

<p>The professor was a powerful man, and there
was more than one story of the corporal punishment
he had inflicted on rebellious students.</p>

<p>“But, professor,” said Jack. “I was going to
have a practice game of baseball with the boys to-day.
The season opens next week, and I’m playing
in a new position. I’ll have to practice!”</p>

<p>“You will remain in your room all of to-day
and to-morrow,” was all the reply the professor
made, as he strode from Jack’s apartment.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>DISQUIETING NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, if this ain’t the meanest thing he’s done
to me yet!” exclaimed Jack, as the door closed on
the retreating form of his crusty guardian.
“This is the limit! The boys expect me to the ball
game, and I can’t get there. That means they’ll
put somebody else in my place, and maybe I’ll have
to be a substitute for the rest of the season. I’ve
a good notion——”</p>

<p>But so many daring thoughts came into Jack’s
mind that he did not know which one to give utterance
to first.</p>

<p>“I’ll not stand it,” he declared. “He hasn’t
any right to punish me like this, for what I did.
He had no right to keep me in. I’ll get out the
same way I did before.”</p>

<p>Jack looked from the window of his room.
Below it, seated on a bench, in the shade of a tree,
was the professor, reading a large book.</p>

<p>“That way’s blocked,” remarked the boy.
“He’ll stay there all day, working out problems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
about how much a dollar will amount to if put out
at interest for a thousand years, or else figuring
how long it will take a man to get to Mars if he
traveled at the rate of a thousand miles a minute,
though what in the world good such knowledge
is I can’t see.</p>

<p>“But I can’t get out while he’s on guard, for he
wouldn’t hesitate to wallop me. And when he
comes in to breakfast his sister will relieve him.
I am certainly up against it!</p>

<p>“Hold on, though! Maybe he forgot to bolt
the door!”</p>

<p>It was a vain hope. Though Jack had not
heard him do it, the professor had softly slid the
bolt across as he went out of the boy’s room, and
our hero was practically a prisoner in his own
apartment.</p>

<p>And this on a beautiful Saturday, when there
was no school and when the first practice baseball
game of the season was to be played. Is it any
wonder that Jack was indignant?</p>

<p>“It’s about time they brought me something to
eat,” he thought, as he heard a clock somewhere
in the house strike nine. “I’m getting hungry.”</p>

<p>He had little fear on the score that the professor
would starve him, for the old college instructor
was not quite as mean as that, and, in a short time,
Miss Klopper appeared with a tray containing
Jack’s breakfast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“I should think you would be ashamed of yourself,”
she said. “The idea of repaying my
brother’s kindness by such acts! You are a wicked
boy!”</p>

<p>Jack wondered where any special kindness on
the part of the professor came in, but he did not
say anything to the old maid whose temper was
even more sour than her brother’s. Since his
parents had left him with the professor, Jack had
never been treated with real kindness. Perhaps
Mr. Klopper did not intend to be mean, but he
was such a deep student that all who did not devote
most of their time to study and research
earned his profound contempt. While Jack was
a good boy, and a fairly good student, he liked
sports and fun, and these the professor detested.
So, when he found that his ward did not intend
to apply himself closely to his books, Professor
Klopper began “putting the screws on,” as Jack
termed it.</p>

<p>Matters had gone from bad to worse, until the
boy was now in a really desperate state. His
naturally good temper had been spoiled by a series
of petty fault-findings, and he had been so hedged
about by the professor and his sister that he was
ripe for almost anything.</p>

<p>All that day he remained in his room, becoming
more and more angry at his imprisonment as
the hours passed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“The boys are on the diamond now,” he said,
as he heard a clock strike three. “They’re practicing,
and soon the game will start. Gee, but I wish
I was there! But it’s no use.”</p>

<p>Another try at the door, and a look out of his
window convinced him of this. The professor
was still on guard, reading his big book.</p>

<p>Toward dusk the professor went in, as he could
see no longer. But, by that time Jack had lost all
desire to escape. He resolved to go to bed, to
make the time pass more quickly, though he knew
he had another day of imprisonment before him.
Sunday was the occasion for long rambles in the
woods and fields with his chums, but he knew he
would have to forego that pleasure now. He
almost hoped it would rain.</p>

<p>As he was undressing there came a hurried
knock on his door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My brother wants to see you at once, in his
study,” said Miss Klopper.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” thought Jack. “Here’s for another
lecture.”</p>

<p>There was no choice but to obey, however, for
Mr. Allen in his last injunction to his son, had
urged him to give every heed to his guardian’s
requests.</p>

<p>He found the professor in his study, with open
books piled all about on a table before which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
sat. In his hand Mr. Klopper held a white slip
of paper.</p>

<p>“Jack,” he said, more kindly than he had spoken
since the trouble between them, “I have here a
telegram concerning your father and mother.”</p>

<p>“Is it—is it bad news?” asked the boy quickly,
for something in the professor’s tone and manner
indicated it.</p>

<p>“Well, I—er—I’m sorry to say it is not good
news. It is rather disquieting. You remember I
told you I cabled to the United States Consul in
Hong Kong concerning your parents, when several
days went by without either of us hearing
from them.”</p>

<p>“What does he say?”</p>

<p>“His cablegram states that your parents went on
an excursion outside of Hong Kong about two
weeks ago, and no word has been received from
them since.”</p>

<p>“Are they—are they killed?”</p>

<p>“No; I do not think so. The consul adds that
as there have been disturbances in China, it is very
likely that Mr. and Mrs. Allen, together with
some other Americans, have been detained in a
friendly province, until the trouble is over. I
thought you had better know this.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose there is any danger?”</p>

<p>“I do not think so. There is no use worrying,
though I was a little anxious when I had no word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
from them. We will hope for the best. I will
cable the consul to send me word as soon as he
has any additional news.”</p>

<p>“Poor mother!” said Jack. “She’s nervous, and
if she gets frightened it may have a bad effect on
her heart.”</p>

<p>“Um,” remarked the professor. He had little
sympathy for ailing women. “In view of this
news I have decided to mitigate your punishment,”
he added to Jack. “You may consider yourself at
liberty to-morrow, though I shall expect you to
spend at least three hours in reading some good
and helpful book. I will pick one out for you.
It is well to train our minds to deep reading, for
there is so much of the frivolous in life now-a-days,
that the young are very likely to form improper
thinking habits. I would recommend that
you spend an hour before you retire to-night, in
improving yourself in Latin. Your conjugation
of verbs was very weak the last time I examined
you.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think I could study to-night,” said
Jack, who felt quite miserable with his enforced
detention in the house, and the unpleasant news
concerning his parents. “I’d be thinking so much
about my father and mother that I couldn’t keep
my attention on the verbs,” he said.</p>

<p>“That indicates a weak intellect,” returned the
professor. “You should labor to overcome it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
However, perhaps it would be useless to have you
do any Latin to-night. But I must insist on you
improving in your studies. Your last report from
the academy was very poor.”</p>

<p>Jack did not answer. With a heavy heart he
went to his room, where he sat for some time in
the dark, thinking of his parents in far-off China.</p>

<p>“I wish I could go and find them,” he said.
“Maybe they need help. I wonder if the professor’d
let me go?”</p>

<p>But, even as that idea came to him, he knew
it would be useless to propose it to Mr. Klopper.</p>

<p>“He’s got enough of money that dad left for
my keep, to pay my passage,” the boy mused on.
“But if I asked for some for a steamship ticket
he’d begin to figure what the interest on it for
a hundred years would be, and then he’d lecture
me about being a spendthrift. No, I’ll have to let
it go, though I do wish I could make a trip abroad.
If I could only earn money enough, some way, I’d
go to China and find dad and mom.”</p>

<p>But even disquieting and sad thoughts can not
long keep awake a healthy lad, and soon Jack was
slumbering. He was up early the next morning,
and, as usual, accompanied the professor to church.</p>

<p>The best part of the afternoon he was forced
to spend in reading a book on what boys ought to
do, written by an old man who, if ever he was a
healthy, sport-loving lad, must have been one so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
many years ago that he forgot that he ever liked
to have fun once in a while.</p>

<p>Jack was glad when night came, so he could
go to bed again.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I’ll see the boys,” he thought to
himself. “They’ll want to know why I didn’t
come to play ball, and I’ll have to tell them the
real reason. I’m getting so I hate Professor
Klopper!”</p>

<p>If Jack had known what was to happen the next
day, he probably would not have slept so soundly.</p>

<small>A SERIOUS ACCUSATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hey</span>, Jack, where were you Saturday?” asked
Tom Berwick, as our hero came into the school
yard Monday morning. “We had a dandy game,”
he went on. “Your catching glove is nifty!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Fred Walton played short,” added Sam
Morton. “We waited as long as we could for you.
What was the matter?”</p>

<p>“The professor made me stay home because I
skipped out the night before to go to the show.”</p>

<p>“Say, he’s a mean old codger,” was Tom’s
opinion, which was echoed by several other lads.</p>

<p>“Is Fred going to play shortstop regularly?”
asked Jack, of Tom Berwick, who was captain of
the Academy nine.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He wants to, but I’d like to
have you play there, Jack. Still, if you can’t come
Saturdays——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll come next Saturday all right. Can’t
we have a little practice this afternoon?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Sure. You can play then, if you want to.
Fred has to go away, he said.”</p>

<p>The boys had a lively impromptu contest on the
diamond when school closed that afternoon, and
Jack proved himself an efficient player at shortstop.
It was getting dusk when he reached the
professor’s house, and the doughty old college instructor
was waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you to come home early, in order
that I might test you in algebra?” he asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But I forgot about it,” which was
the truth for, in the excitement over the game,
Jack had no mind for anything but baseball.</p>

<p>“Where were you?” went on Mr. Klopper.</p>

<p>“Playing ball.”</p>

<p>“Playing ball! An idle, frivolous amusement.
It tends to no good, and does positive harm. I
have no sympathy with that game. It gives no
time for reflection. I once watched a game at
the college where I used to teach. I saw several
men standing at quite some distance from the bare
spot where one man was throwing a ball at another,
with a stick in his hand.”</p>

<p>“That was the diamond,” volunteered Jack,
hoping the professor might get interested in hearing
about the game, and so forego the lecture that
was in prospect.</p>

<p>“Ah, a very inappropriate name. Such an
utterly valueless game should not be designated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
any such expensive stone as a diamond. But what
I was going to say was that I saw some of the
players standing quite some distance from the bare
spot——”</p>

<p>“They were in the outfield, professor. Right
field, left field and centre.”</p>

<p>“One moment; I care nothing about the names
of the contestants. I was about to remark that
those distant players seemed to have little to do
with the game. They might, most profitably have
had a book with them, to study while they were
standing there, but they did not. Instead they remained
idle—wasting their time.”</p>

<p>“But they might have had to catch a ball any
moment.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the professor. “It is an
idle frivolous amusement, and I regret very much
that you wasted your valuable time over it. After
supper I want to hear you read some Virgil, and
also do some problems in geometry. I was instructed
by your father to see that your education
was not neglected, and I must do my duty, no
matter how disagreeable it is.”</p>

<p>Jack sighed. He had studied hard in class that
day, and now to be made to put in the evening over
his books he thought was very unfair.</p>

<p>But there was no escape from the professor,
and the boy had to put in two hours at his Latin
and mathematics, which studies, though they undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
did him good, were very distasteful to
him.</p>

<p>“You are making scarcely any progress,” said
the professor, when Jack had failed to properly
answer several of his questions. “I want you to
come home early from school to-morrow afternoon,
and I will give you my undivided attention
until bedtime. I am determined that you shall
learn.”</p>

<p>Jack said nothing, but he did not think it would
be wise to go off playing ball the next afternoon,
though the boys urged him strongly.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you write and tell your dad how
mean old Klopper is treating you?” suggested
Tom, when Jack explained the reason for going
straight home from his classes.</p>

<p>“I would if I knew how to reach him. But I
don’t know where he is,” and Jack sighed, for
he was becoming more and more alarmed at the
long delay in hearing from his father.</p>

<p>But Jack was destined to do no studying that
afternoon under the watchful eye of Professor
Klopper. He had no sooner entered the house
than he was made aware that something unusual
had happened.</p>

<p>“My brother is waiting for you in the library,”
said Miss Klopper, and Jack noticed that she was
excited over something.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s bad news about the folks,” the boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
thought, but when he saw that the professor had
no cablegram, he decided it could not be that.</p>

<p>“Jack,” began the aged teacher, “I have a very
serious matter to speak about.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s coming now?” thought the
boy.</p>

<p>“Do you recall the night you disobeyed me, and,
sneaking out of your window like a thief, you
went to a—er—a theatrical performance without
my permission?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, wondering if his
guardian thought he was likely to forget it so soon.</p>

<p>“Do you also recollect me asking you where you
got the money wherewith to go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I now, once more, demand that you tell me
where you obtained it, and, let me warn you that
it is serious. I insist that you answer me. Where
did you get that money?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t want to tell you, Professor
Klopper.”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” came the indignant answer, for there
were few things of which Jack Allen was afraid.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t think you have a right to know
everything that I do. I am not a baby. I assure
you I got that money in a perfectly legitimate
way.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Oh, you did?” sneered the professor. “We
shall see about that. Come in,” he called, and, to
Jack’s surprise the door opened and Miss Klopper
entered the library.</p>

<p>“I believe you have something to say on a subject
that interests all present,” went on the professor,
in icy tones.</p>

<p>“She knows nothing of where I got the money,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“We shall see,” remarked Mr. Klopper. “You
may tell what you know,” he added to his sister.</p>

<p>“I saw Jack just as he got down out of his
window,” Miss Klopper stated, as if she was reciting
a lesson. “He had a bundle with him. I
asked what it was and he would not tell me.”</p>

<p>“Is that correct?” inquired the former teacher.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, wondering how the
professor could be interested in his catching
glove, which was what the bundle had contained.</p>

<p>“What was in that package?” went on the
professor.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t care to tell, sir.”</p>

<p>“I insist that you shall. Once again, I warn
you that it is a very serious matter.”</p>

<p>Jack could not quite understand why, so he kept
silent.</p>

<p>“Well, are you going to tell me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Jack had no particular reason for not telling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
but he had made up his mind that the professor
had no right to know, and he was not going to give
in to him.</p>

<p>“This is your last chance,” warned his guardian.
“Are you going to tell me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you what was in that package.
It was my gold loving cup, that the teachers of
Underhill College presented to me on the occasion
of my retirement from the faculty of that institution!”</p>

<p>“Your loving cup?” repeated Jack in amazement,
for that cup was one of the professor’s
choicest possessions, and quite valuable.</p>

<p>“Yes, my loving cup. You had it in that
bundle, and you took it out to pawn it, in order to
get money to go to that show.”</p>

<p>“That’s not true!” cried Jack indignantly. “All
I had in that bundle was my catching glove, which
I sold to Tom Berwick.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you,” said the professor stiffly.
“I say you stole my loving cup and pawned it.
The cup is gone from its accustomed place on my
dresser. I did not miss it until this afternoon,
and, when I asked my sister about it, she said she
had not seen it. Then she recalled your sneaking
away from the house with a bundle, and I at once
knew what had become of it.”</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p040.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“I say you took my cup!”<br />

<span class="illoright"><i>Page <a href="#Page_41">41</a></i></span></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“You couldn’t know, for there is absolutely no
truth in this accusation,” replied Jack hotly.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that I am telling an untruth?”
asked the professor sharply. “I say that
you took my cup.”</p>

<p>“And I say that I didn’t! I never touched your
cup! If it’s gone some one else took it!”</p>

<p>Jack spoke in loud and excited tones.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare contradict me, young man!”
thundered the former teacher. “I will not permit
it. I say you took that cup! I know you
did!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>The professor was so angry that he took a step
toward the lad. He raised his hand, probably
unconsciously, as though to deal Jack a box on the
ear, for this was the old teacher’s favorite method
of correcting a refractory student.</p>

<p>Jack, with the instinct of a lad who will assume
a defensive attitude on the first sign of an attack,
doubled up his fists.</p>

<p>“What! You dare attempt to strike me?”
cried the professor. “You dare?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to have you hit me,” murmured
Jack. “You are making an unjust charge. I never
took that cup. I can prove what I had in that
package by Tom Berwick.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe you,” went on the professor.
“I know you pawned that cup to get spending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
money, because I refused to give you any to waste.
I will give you a chance to confess, and tell me
where you disposed of it, before I take harsh
measures.”</p>

<p>Jack started. What did the professor mean by
harsh measures?</p>

<p>“I can’t confess what I did not do,” he said,
more quietly. “I never took the loving cup.”</p>

<p>“And I say you did!” cried the old teacher,
seeming to lose control of himself. “I say you
stole it, and I’ll have you arrested, you young
rascal! Go to your room at once, and remain
there until I get an officer. We’ll see then whether
you’ll confess or not. I’ll call in a policeman at
once. See that he does not leave the house,” he
added to his sister, as he hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Jack started from the library.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Miss Klopper,
placing herself in his path. She was a large
woman, and strong.</p>

<p>“I am going to my room,” replied Jack, sore
at heart and very miserable over the unjust
accusation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>JACK RUNS AWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> closed the door of his apartment and sat
down in a chair by the bed. His mind was in a
whirl. He wondered if the professor would carry
out his threat, and call an officer.</p>

<p>“He’s mean enough to,” thought the boy. “But
I don’t see how he can accuse me of taking that
cup. I know he values it very highly, and feels
very badly over its loss, if it is gone, but I had
nothing to do with it. I can easily prove, by Tom
Berwick, that it was a glove I had in the bundle.”</p>

<p>Then another thought came to Jack. He
remembered that, after getting out of sight of the
house, he had thrown away the paper from the
catching glove. All Tom could say was that his
chum had sold him a glove. Tom would know
nothing about any bundle that Jack had carried
away from the professor’s house.</p>

<p>“I may have hard work proving that I only took
the glove with me,” mused Jack. “The professor
is so quick tempered that he’ll not believe such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
proof as I can bring forward. It looks as if I
was in a hole.”</p>

<p>The more Jack thought it over the less inclined
he was to await the return of the professor with
an officer.</p>

<p>“I’ll not submit to the disgrace of an arrest,
even though I know I am innocent,” he declared.
“That’s carrying things too far. If dad was only
here——”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and a lump came into his
throat, while there was suspicious moisture in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“This is the limit!” the boy exclaimed, at
length. “I’m not going to stand it! I’ll skip out!
I’ll run away! I’ll go anywhere rather than stay
in this house any longer!</p>

<p>“Whatever happens to me, or wherever I go I
can’t be much worse off than I have been here,
with old Klopper and his sister. I’ve got a little
money left, and I guess I can get work somewhere.
I’ll pack up my clothes and leave. Dad wouldn’t
blame me, if he knew. Neither would mother.
I’ll go; that’s what I’ll do!”</p>

<p>Once he had formed this resolution Jack set
about ways and means. First he looked to see how
much money he had.</p>

<p>“Two dollars and fifteen cents,” he said, as he
counted the change. “Not an awful lot, but I’ll
have to make it do. I wish there was another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
show coming to town. Maybe I could make a
little money doing my clown stunt on amateur
night. But I haven’t any time to wait for such a
thing as that. I’ve got to get out at once.”</p>

<p>Next he began to consider what he had better
take with him. He had several suits of clothes,
and a plentiful supply of other garments. Selecting
the best he placed them in his dress-suit case.</p>

<p>“Now to get away,” he murmured. “The professor
will have to go to town for an officer, and
he can’t get back inside a half hour. I’ve got about
fifteen minutes left. Guess I’d better go by the
window. That old cat of a sister of his will probably
be on the watch downstairs if I go out the
door.”</p>

<p>Jack gave a last look around the room that had
been his for the past year. There were no very
pleasant memories connected with it. He saw his
school books lying on a shelf.</p>

<p>“I won’t need you, where I’m going,” he said.
“The term is almost closed. By the time I get
ready to come back, or hear from my folks I can
start a new term, but I hope I’ll never have anything
more to do with Professor Klopper.”</p>

<p>Jack went to the window to look out, to see if it
would be safe to drop the suit case, and then follow
himself. To his surprise, coming over the back
path, which he often used as a short cut to the
village, he saw the professor and a policeman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“It’s too late!” he exclaimed. “He took the
short way home, and got here quicker than I
thought he would. He kept his threat, and is
going to have me arrested. What’ll I do?”</p>

<p>Jack thought rapidly. He had made up his mind
that he would not submit to the indignity of being
taken into custody, even though he thought he
could, after some trouble, prove his innocence of
the charge.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to let them get me,” said Jack
softly. “What had I better do? I know. I’ll hide
in the big attic closet. He’ll never think to look
for me there. But, before I go I’ll just make them
think I got away out of the window. Then they
won’t spend so much time looking for me.”</p>

<p>Jack took a piece of rope, one of the many things
in his room which he had stowed away, thinking he
might some day find a use for it. He tied one end
to his bed, and threw the other out of the window,
taking care that the approaching professor and the
officer should not see him.</p>

<p>“There, they’ll think I got down by that,” he
said, “though I never use it. The lightning rod is
good enough for me. Now to hide!”</p>

<p>Softly opening his door, which, fortunately was
not bolted, and carrying his dress-suit case, he went
up to the big attic, which took up the entire third
story of the professor’s house. There was a roomy
closet, or store room in it, and, selecting a place behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
a large chest, Jack sat down there, stowing
his case away out of sight.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’ll find me here,” he said,
with a smile. “Gee, but I’m glad I decided to skip
out! I couldn’t stand it any longer!”</p>

<p>He listened intently, and soon he heard his name
being called by the professor.</p>

<p>“They’ve found out I’m not in my room,” he
said. “Well, let ’em hunt.”</p>

<p>He heard his name being shouted again.</p>

<p>“That’s Miss Klopper,” he remarked. “I’ve
fooled ’em.”</p>

<p>Then he heard confused sounds throughout the
house, and he knew they were searching for him.
But he had selected his hiding place well. Besides,
the dangling rope did deceive the professor
and the policeman.</p>

<p>“The rascal has gotten away,” said Mr. Klopper,
when a superficial search of the house failed
to reveal the boy. “I did not think he would do
that.”</p>

<p>“Most any boy would, under the circumstances,”
observed the policeman grimly. “You shouldn’t
have told him you were going to have him arrested.
If you’d come away quietly and got me
we would have him now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get him yet,” declared the professor savagely.
“I will compel him to tell me where he
pawned my gold loving cup. I shall also cable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
his father of what he has done, as soon as I get
his address. I never supposed, after all my teaching,
that Jack would prove such a rascal.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he didn’t take the cup,” suggested the
officer.</p>

<p>“I know he did,” insisted the former teacher,
as if that settled it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jack remained in hiding. He heard
the house grow more quiet after the officer took
his departure. The professor had given up the
search, though he had asked the authorities to send
out a general alarm for the runaway boy.</p>

<p>“It must be quite dark outside by now,” thought
Jack, after an hour or more behind the big chest.
“I wonder if it’s safe to venture downstairs? I’m
almost starved, for I didn’t have any supper.
Guess I’d better wait a while. The professor and
his sister go to bed early, and they’re sound sleepers.
Then I’ll sneak out and get something from
the pantry.”</p>

<p>He waited another hour. Then, taking off his
shoes, and carrying them in one hand, while in
the other he carried the dress-suit case, he stole
down the attic stairs.</p>

<p>He listened intently. There was not a sound.
The house was dark, and, as he stood there,
anxiously waiting, he heard a clock strike ten.</p>

<p>“They’re asleep,” he said softly. “Now for
something to eat.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>He made his way to the pantry. He struck a
match, one of a supply he always carried, and
found a piece of candle. This he lighted, and, by
its flickering glow, he made a meal from cold
victuals which were on the shelves.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll take a little lunch with me,” he remarked
softly. “It may come in handy.”</p>

<p>He did up some bread and meat, a bit of cake,
and a piece of pie in a paper, which he thrust into
his pocket. Then, having put on his shoes, and
grasping his case, he let himself out of the front
door.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve run away,” he remarked grimly, as
he looked back at the dark and silent house. “Now
for a free life, without being scolded every minute
by old Klopper. I’ve got the whole world before
me, and I shouldn’t care if I never came back, if
I could only get to where dad and mom are.”</p>

<p>Poor Jack! he little realized what was in store
for him before he would see his parents again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>A NARROW ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the one thought firm in his mind, to get
safely away from the house, Jack gave little heed
which way he went. Naturally he headed away
from the village, for he knew, late as it was, nearly
midnight now, some one would be about who might
know him.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to keep out of sight for a while,”
thought the boy. “If I guess right, the professor
will be so mad because I have run away that he’ll
have the police in all the nearby places on the lookout
for me. Nearly every officer in Westville
knows me, so I don’t want to meet any of them.”</p>

<p>He walked on, keeping in the shadows, until he
was about a mile from the house, having traveled
in an opposite direction to that in which the village
was situated.</p>

<p>“I’d better make out a plan of campaign, the
way Cæsar did,” he said. “Queer I should think
of that old warrior, when I hate Latin so, but then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
he knew a good deal about battles, though I don’t
remember that he ever ran away much.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” he went on musingly. “If I go this
way I’ll reach Cloverdale in about an hour. They
have a regular uniformed force there, and probably
they’ve been warned by telephone to look out
for a boy with a dress-suit case. If I bear off to the
left I’ll get to Pendleton in two hours. There are
only a couple of constables there, and I don’t believe
they’ll be on the watch for me. From Pendleton
I can take a train to some other place.”</p>

<p>Jack thought matters over a little more. He
wanted to be sure and make no mistake, as this was
a very important period in his life. He recalled
several stories he had read of boys running away,
but none of them seemed to fit his case.</p>

<p>“The trouble is, I don’t know just where to go,”
he thought. “I don’t want to go to sea, I don’t
care about going out west to fight Indians or dig
for gold, and there’s no special kind of work I can
do. The only thing I would like to do would be to
find my folks. Maybe I can, some time, though
when I’ll have money enough to go to China I’m
sure I don’t know. I wonder where I’d better go
after I get to Pendleton?”</p>

<p>Jack thought hard. It was quite a problem for
the lad. There were so many things to consider.
First of all, of course, was to keep out of the
clutches of a policeman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“I think I’ll go to Rudford,” he announced to
himself. “That’s quite a town, and it’s far enough
off so that the professor will not think of telephoning
to it. It will take almost all my money to
get there, but when I arrive I’ll have a better
chance to get a job than I would have in these
small towns. I’ll go to Rudford. There’s a train
from Pendleton to Rudford about three o’clock.
I can just make it.”</p>

<p>Off he trudged once more, proceeding faster,
now that he had a definite plan before him. It
was rather lonesome, walking along the deserted
country road at night, but Jack had no fears. The
worst he could meet with would be tramps, and he
did not worry about them.</p>

<p>Still, as he came to a stretch where the road ran
through a rather dense patch of woods, he was
a little nervous, especially when he heard something
stirring in the forest close to the highway.
He stood still, and he could feel his heart pounding
against his ribs.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s a crowd of tramps,” he thought,
for, of late, several members of that road fraternity
had been committing petty depredations in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>The rustling in the woods became louder. It
seemed as if some one was running toward the
road, snapping the branches under foot.</p>

<p>Then, from the darkness of the woods, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
bright eyes peered out at Jack, reflecting in the
light of the new moon. They showed red and
green.</p>

<p>“An animal,” said the lad to himself, with a sigh
of relief. “A fox, most likely.”</p>

<p>Then a distant owl hooted, and the fox, if such
the beast was, disappeared like a flash.</p>

<p>“I might have known it,” thought Jack, but,
nevertheless, it was some time before his heart
beat regularly. At length he saw a distant light,
and knew that he was approaching Pendleton.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon be there,” he thought. “Then for a
ride on the train, and, as soon as it’s daylight, I’ll
look for work in Rudford. I ought to get a place
easily. I’m strong for my age.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Jack was tramping through
the silent streets of the village, on his way to the
railroad station. He had been there once before,
when the Academy nine played the Pendleton
team, and he knew his way about.</p>

<p>Just as the youth was turning a dark corner, on
a street which he remembered led to the depot, he
heard some one coming toward him. He peered
ahead, and, from the fact that the man he saw
carried a long club, he concluded that the person
was a constable.</p>

<p>“I mustn’t let him see me,” thought the boy.
“It’s just possible there’s an alarm for me here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
The dress-suit case will give me away, sure. I’d
better hide it until he gets past.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, Jack was in the dense shadow cast
by a building. The constable was coming directly
toward him, and if he turned back, the officer
would hear him. A sudden idea came to the lad.</p>

<p>Setting his dress-suit case down in the doorway,
where it would be out of sight, Jack advanced
boldly to meet the constable. The officer rather
started on beholding the boy appear from out of
the shadow.</p>

<p>“Can you please tell me the way to the railroad
station?” asked Jack. “I want to get a train.”</p>

<p>“Right down this street,” replied the officer,
which fact Jack knew well. “Out rather late,
aren’t you?” asked the officer suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well, it is late,” admitted Jack, as if some one
had disputed it. “But I couldn’t get here any
sooner,” which was the truth. “I’m on my way to
Rudford, to work,” he added. “I had to leave
rather suddenly, and this is the first train I could
get. There’s one about three, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>He was glad he knew something about the timetable,
though it was not much.</p>

<p>“Three-eight,” replied the officer. “You haven’t
seen anything of a lad with a dress-suit case, have
you?”</p>

<p>“A lad with a dress-suit case?” repeated Jack,
as though such a curiosity was not to be met with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
outside of a circus. Then the alarm for him had
been sent here, after all, he thought. But his
natural manner fooled the constable.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on the officer. “We’ve got orders
to arrest a lad with a dress-suit case. Telephone
came from the police at Westville.”</p>

<p>“What’s he wanted for?”</p>

<p>As if Jack did not know!</p>

<p>“Stealing a gold cup from some professor there.
I don’t know much about the case. I was only told
to arrest a lad with a dress-suit case, and I’m looking
for him. I thought you was him, first, but you
haven’t any case.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” spoke Jack, hoping the one in the
doorway would not be seen.</p>

<p>“I’d like to arrest him,” continued the constable.
“I hear there’s a reward offered for him,
and I’d like to get it.”</p>

<p>Evidently, Professor Klopper must have been
very much incensed over his ward’s escape to offer
a reward, for he was very fond of money. Jack
resolved to use every means to avoid capture.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d better be getting on,” said the officer.
“If you go right down this street you’ll come to
the depot. You can just make the train. Generally
it’s a little late. If you see a lad with a suit
case, tell the first constable you meet.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” answered Jack, and grinned to
himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>He walked on slowly, looking back once or twice
to see if the constable was watching him. But that
officer evidently had no suspicions, for he did not
once peer after Jack.</p>

<p>When the man had gone some distance, and had
turned down a side street, Jack ventured to retrace
his steps and get his suit case.</p>

<p>“I can’t leave that behind,” he thought. “It’s
all I’ve got in the world now.”</p>

<p>He reached the station without further incident,
congratulating himself upon his narrow escape.
Then, as he walked up the depot platform, he
resolved to practice another bit of caution.</p>

<p>“The agent there has probably been warned to
be on the lookout for me,” he reasoned. “My
dress-suit case seems to be the most conspicuous
part of my make-up. I’ll just leave it outside when
I go in to buy a ticket.”</p>

<p>He was glad he did so, for, when he asked for
passage to Rudford, the agent, rousing himself
from his nap, looked out of the little brass-barred
window at the boy in front of him. Very evidently
he was looking to see if Jack carried a suit
case.</p>

<p>“No baggage?” he remarked, in questioning accents.</p>

<p>“Not so’s you could notice it,” replied Jack,
making use of a bit of slang that served his purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
well, without compelling him to make a direct
statement.</p>

<p>He went outside, got his case, and remained in
the shadow of the depot shed until the train came
along.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>THE SIDE-DOOR PULLMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> fancied that the conductor, when he took
up his ticket, looked suspiciously at him, but probably
this was only the result of his imagination.
At any rate, the runaway was glad when the train
stopped at Rudford, and he could get out.</p>

<p>It was early morning, and rather cool, in spite
of the fact that it was the last of June.</p>

<p>“A cup of coffee and some rolls for mine,”
thought Jack, as he saw a small refreshment stand
in the station.</p>

<p>The food tasted good to him, and he decided it
was wiser to spend a little of his money for it than
to draw on the supply of cold victuals in his pocket.</p>

<p>“No telling when I’ll need them,” he thought,
“and I want to be in good shape to look for work.”
Then another thought came to him. He could not
very well go about looking for a job carrying his
suit case. Besides, it would look suspicious, in case
there was any alarm here for him. He saw a notice
at the refreshment stand to the effect that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
valises and small parcels would be checked at the
rate of ten cents a day.</p>

<p>“That will suit me,” decided Jack, and he
handed over his large valise, receiving for it a
paper check. “Now I can travel about better,” he
added.</p>

<p>Jack’s one idea now was to get a place to work.
He did not intend to stay permanently in Rudford,
but he wanted to earn enough money to take him
to some larger place, and that he needed money
was very evident, when he looked over his cash
and found he had less than a dollar. The railroad
ticket had taken the most of his small capital.</p>

<p>Now, whether Jack was not exactly the sort of
boy the merchants needed, or whether there was already
a plentiful supply of lads already in town,
or whether there were more boys than there were
jobs, Jack did not stop to figure out. The fact was,
however, that he tramped about all that morning,
asking in a score or more of places for work, without
getting it.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t going to be as easy as I though it
was,” he said to himself. “Tramping about makes
me hungry. I’ve got to eat. I’d better tackle the
stuff I brought from the professor’s house. The
longer I keep that, the staler it’ll get, until I won’t
be able to eat it after a while. There’s enough for
dinner and supper, and for breakfast. We’ll see
what turns up to-morrow.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>He found a secluded spot, where he dined frugally
on the bread and meat, and the piece of pie.
He washed it down with some cool water from a
street fountain. But, oh how he wished he could
have an ice cream soda!</p>

<p>Signs advertising the various flavors of that
drink seemed to stare at him from every drug store
and confectionery shop window, and, as it was
warm from the sun, Jack longed for the cool beverage.</p>

<p>“But I can’t afford it,” he decided. “Five cents
will get me a cup of coffee in the morning, and I’ll
need that more than I need a soda now.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon he resumed his search for work,
but with no success. Once, as he was passing a
printing shop, he saw displayed that magical sign:
“<i>Boy Wanted.</i>”</p>

<p>“I see you want a boy,” he remarked, as he went
in. “I’d like to get the job.”</p>

<p>“Can you kick a press?” asked the man, evidently
favorably impressed by Jack’s appearance.</p>

<p>“Kick a press? Why should I kick a press?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy to see you don’t know anything
about the printing business,” remarked the proprietor,
with a smile. “I need a boy to kick a press,
run one with his feet, I mean, and set up simple
jobs; but it wouldn’t pay me to hire one who
doesn’t understand the work.”</p>

<p>“I could learn,” said Jack.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“No, I haven’t any time to teach you, and you’d
spoil more work than you’d be worth. Sorry,” and
he turned back to his desk.</p>

<p>“I can’t kick a press,” thought Jack, as he went
out, “but I can kick a football. Only there’s no
chance on the gridiron these days. Wonder if I
could get a job in some theatre?”</p>

<p>This plan seemed good to him, as he remembered
how he had been applauded that amateur
night, but he was doomed to disappointment, for,
on inquiring of a man, he learned there were no
theatres open in Rudford.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the end of that,” mused our hero.
“I’ll try a few more places for a job, though it’s
most closing time. I wonder where I’ll sleep to-night?
Running away isn’t as nice and easy as I
thought it was.”</p>

<p>His search for work was unavailing. He
walked along the street, feeling quite blue and
lonesome, when something happened that caused
a great change in his plans. This was the sight of
a small type-written notice tacked on a bulletin
board outside of a red brick building. The building,
Jack decided, as soon as he had looked at it,
was a police station.</p>

<p>The notice which so startled him was one offering
a reward for his capture. Before he realized
the danger of it, Jack had come to a halt, and was
reading the statement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>A reward of fifty dollars was offered by Professor
Klopper for the arrest of the runaway, who
was charged with the theft of a valuable gold cup.
Jack was not very accurately described, for the
professor was not aware how his ward was dressed,
since Jack had taken several suits with him. Police
and others, however, were advised to be on the
lookout for a boy with a dress-suit case.</p>

<p>“I wish I didn’t have it,” thought Jack. “But
there’s no help for it now. That’s the only thing
they’ll recognize me by. But I’d better be getting
out of here.”</p>

<p>He hurried past the police station, and, just as
he came opposite the entrance, an officer rushed
out. He collided with the boy, and, to save them
both from falling, grabbed the lad.</p>

<p>“I’m caught,” thought Jack desperately. But it
was merely an accident.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” spoke the officer, as he released
Jack. “I’m hurrying to stop a fight down
the street. Word about it has just been telephoned
in. I didn’t see you.”</p>

<p>“No, and you won’t again, if I can prevent it,”
thought Jack, as he hastened on, glad that the excitement
over the collision had caused the officer
to pass on without taking a good look at him.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get out of town as quickly as possible,”
thought the startled lad. “This place isn’t
safe for me. I wonder where I’d better go? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
must get my suit case, and then see where I can get
a ticket for.”</p>

<p>He went back to the depot, presented his check,
and received his case. As he reached his hand in
his pocket to get the ten cents, he was startled to
find but a single coin there. It was a dime. He
paid it to the man at the refreshment booth, and
then, walking to one side, began a hurried search
for the rest of his cash. It was gone!</p>

<p>“Some one either picked my pocket, or else it
was jarred out when that policeman ran into me,”
he said. “Lucky there was this ten cents left.
Now I <i>am</i> up against it.”</p>

<p>What was he to do? With no money, how
could he get out of the town where, doubtless,
every officer was on the watch for him, anxious to
earn the reward? It was a serious problem.</p>

<p>“I mustn’t hang around here,” thought Jack.
“They’ll probably be watching the railroad stations.
I’ve got to walk about and think a bit.”</p>

<p>He hardly noticed where he turned his steps, but
he was brought out of his unpleasant day-dream
by hearing some one address him.</p>

<p>“What’s de matter, cully?” a voice asked.
“You look sort of cheesy.”</p>

<p>Jack saw that the speaker was a tramp, but
rather a good-natured looking one, and not quite
so dirty and disreputable as the average. The boy
also noticed, for the first time, that he was passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
along a street which bordered the railroad freight
yard, and that there were long strings of cars on
a track adjoining the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Down on yer luck?” asked the man.</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“What’s de matter?” went on the tramp.
“Runaway, an’ sorry fer it?”</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit sorry,” answered Jack, as he
thought of the mean professor. “But I want to
get out of town, and I’ve lost all my money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dat’s easy,” remarked the tramp, though
whether he referred to losing the money or getting
out of town, Jack was not quite sure.</p>

<p>“If you want t’ make a git-away, I kin fix youse
up,” went on the ragged man.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Jack, becoming interested.</p>

<p>“I’ll show youse how t’ git inter a side-door Pullman,
an’ youse kin ride as fur as youse wants.”</p>

<p>“A side-door Pullman?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Freight car, wid de side door; ain’t
youse wise to dem yet? Dat’s a swell way of travelin’
when youse ain’t got de chink. Come on, I’ll
put youse next t’ one. Dere’s a freight bein’ made
up, an’ dere’s a lot of empties in it. Be youse particular
which way youse goes?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“Dat’s good. I am. I want t’ go west, but
dere’s a train bound fer de east goin’ t’ pull out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
t’-night. I’ll help youse git inter one of de side-door
Pullmans on dat. Come on.”</p>

<p>Jack followed the man, who, after a cautious
look around, to make sure that there were no police
or trainmen watching, led the way into the
freight yard. He stopped before an empty box
car, with an open door.</p>

<p>“In youse go,” he said cheerfully, helping Jack
to climb up. “Dere’s yer baggage,” he added.
“Now youse is all right, cully. Git off whenever
youse feels like it. Yer ticket’s good anywhere,”
and, sliding the door almost shut, he walked away,
leaving Jack in the car.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>JACK LOSES SOMETHING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, things are certainly happening to me,”
mused Jack, as he tried to find the softest board
in the floor of the freight car, whereon to sit. He
finally decided that his dress-suit case would make
the best kind of a stool, and, turning it upon end,
he sat on it, leaning back against the side of the
“Pullman.”</p>

<p>“Two days ago I would no more have thought
I’d be in this position than I would of trying to fly.
Yet here I am, I’ve run away from the professor,
there’s a reward for my arrest, I have just escaped
in time, and now I’m bound for I don’t know
where. Things are certainly happening to me.
Let’s see; that tramp said this train was going east.
I don’t suppose it makes much difference to me, but
I almost wish it was going west. I’d like to find
out what’s become of my folks, and the nearer I get
to California, the better chance I have of hearing
news from China. I think, after I get far enough
away so there’s no danger of me being arrested,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
I’ll strike out for San Francisco. When I get there
I may have a chance to work my passage to
China.”</p>

<p>This thought comforted Jack somewhat. As he
sat in the dark car, going over in his mind what
had happened in the last twenty-four hours, he was
suddenly nearly thrown to the floor as the vehicle
gave a lurch, following a loud crash. Another car
had bumped into the one in which Jack was.</p>

<p>“They’re making up the train,” he said, as he
heard the engine whistle. “We’ll be moving pretty
soon.”</p>

<p>He went to the door and peered out of the
small opening the tramp had left. He could see
brakemen running to and fro in the freight yard,
while men in greasy blue suits, carrying flaming
torches, for it was now getting dark, made hasty
examinations of the running gear and trucks of the
cars, so that any breaks might be detected before
the train started, while journal boxes, in which
rest the wheel axles, that had not a sufficient
amount of waste and oil, were filled, so that the
axles would not get hot, producing what is known
in railroad terms as a “hot box.”</p>

<p>Then came more signals from the locomotive.
Jack heard men shouting out orders. Next came
two short, sharp blasts from the whistle.</p>

<p>“That means we’re going to start,” thought the
boy, and, a moment later, with many a squeak and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
shrill protest from the wheels, the freight train
was under way.</p>

<p>Jack soon discovered that riding in a “side-door
Pullman” was not very comfortable. The freight
car was not as well provided with springs as even
an ordinary day coach, and as it went bumping
along over the rails, he was jostled about considerably.</p>

<p>“Guess if I got in a corner and braced myself, I
could ride easier,” he thought, and, carrying his
suit case there, he made himself as comfortable as
possible.</p>

<p>“This is better,” he remarked to himself.
“Guess I’ll eat now, though I must save some food
for breakfast. But what am I going to drink? I
never thought of that.”</p>

<p>There was no solution of that problem, and Jack
was forced to make a very dry meal on about half
of what remained of the food he had brought from
the professor’s pantry. In a little while he was
more thirsty than before.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I’m going to stand it,” he
said ruefully. “I’ll choke pretty soon. I’d ought
to have brought a bottle of soda water along. I’ll
know better next time. I can’t get out now. The
train’s going too fast.”</p>

<p>The car was swaying from side to side, and to
jump from it was out of the question. There was
nothing to do but stand it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“I’ll get out at the first stop,” thought Jack, but
he did not know that he was on a through freight,
which made but few stops.</p>

<p>Soon, in spite of his thirst, Jack felt sleepy. He
was very tired, and the monotonous sound of the
wheels clicking over the rail joints produced a sort
of hypnotic effect. Before he knew it, he was slumbering,
having slipped down from his dress-suit
case, to lie at full length on the hard floor of the
car, his head pillowed on the valise and his
bundled-up coat.</p>

<p>When Jack awoke with a start, some hours later,
he saw by the daylight streaming in through the
partly opened door of the car, that it was morning.
He got up, feeling lame and stiff, and, for a moment,
he could scarcely remember where he was.</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked, with a grim smile, as he
donned his coat, “the conductor didn’t take up my
ticket, and the porter hasn’t blacked my shoes, but
I guess I’ll have to let it go. I expect I need a
good brushing down, too.</p>

<p>“I wonder whereabouts I am,” he went on.
“Guess I’ll take a look. I want to get off as soon
as I can. My, but I’m dry! My tongue’s like a
piece of leather!”</p>

<p>He picked up his suit case and went to the side
door. He caught a glimpse of green fields through
which the train was moving.</p>

<p>Setting the case down in front of the door, Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
put his hands in the crack, to make it wider, in
order that he might see better. The door stuck a
little, and he had to use considerable strength to
shove it, but he finally found it was giving.</p>

<p>He had one glimpse of a broad sweep of pretty
country, with a range of low mountains in the distance,
and then something happened.</p>

<p>The train gave a sudden swerve as it went
around a sharp curve. The abrupt change in motion
nearly threw Jack from the car, but, instinctively,
he clung to the edge of the door with all his
strength.</p>

<p>Just then the train thundered over a bridge
spanning a small river. The car rocked and
swayed with the motion imparted to it by the curve,
and then, before Jack could put out a hand to catch
it, his dress-suit case toppled over and slid out of
the open door, falling down into the river. Jack
could see the splash it made, as it disappeared beneath
the water, and then, as the train rolled on,
the rumbling caused by passing over the bridge was
changed to a duller sound, as solid ground was
reached.</p>

<p>“My suit case!” exclaimed Jack, leaning from
the door and looking back. “I can’t afford to lose
that! I must get it. Maybe it’ll float, and perhaps
the river isn’t very deep. I must get out at
the next stop and go back after it. But will the
train stop anywhere near here?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Anxiously he noted the speed. It did seem as if
the cars were not going quite so fast now.</p>

<p>“If they slow up a little more, I’ll risk it and
jump,” said the boy. “I’ve got to get that suit
case!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>A FRUITLESS SEARCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Holding</span> fast to the edge of the door, to steady
himself against the swaying of the car, which was
now rumbling along over an uneven piece of track,
Jack peered ahead to see if there was a station in
view.</p>

<p>“Yet perhaps this freight doesn’t stop at the
regular stations,” he remarked. “I’m in a pretty
mess, I am. Guess I’d better take lessons in traveling
in side-door Pullmans. I need a keeper, I
do. Why couldn’t I have left the case in the
corner? Then the lurch of the car wouldn’t have
toppled it out. Well, it’s easy enough to think
that now, but that won’t bring it back.</p>

<p>“That looks like a station just ahead there,” he
went on. “And I certainly think the train’s slowing
up. I believe I could almost jump now.”</p>

<p>But a look at the ground directly below him
showed that the car he was in was moving too rapidly
to permit of a safe leap. Then came a perceptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
slacking of the train’s speed. At the same
time there was a long whistle from the engine.</p>

<p>“That means put on brakes,” reasoned Jack,
who knew a little about railroads. “I believe we’re
going to stop. Oh, I see,” he added, a moment
later. “That’s a water tank just ahead there, instead
of a station. They’ve got to stop for water.
I’m glad of that; I’d rather not get out near a station.
Some one might want to arrest me, though I
must be pretty well disguised with all the dirt I’ve
gathered up from the floor of this car.”</p>

<p>A little later the train came to a stop, and Jack
leaped from the car and started back over the route
he had come. He saw a little brook running along
the railroad embankment.</p>

<p>“Water!” he exclaimed. “Just what I need
most in the world, next to my suit case. Whew!
But I’m thirsty!”</p>

<p>He found the water cool and good, and drank
heartily. Then he washed his hands and face,
and felt better. He brushed as much dirt as possible
from his clothes, and then took to the track,
intending to walk along it until he came to the
river in which his valise had tumbled.</p>

<p>“I might as well make my breakfast as I go
along,” he reasoned, as he took from his pocket the
last of his scanty supply of food. “Not very appetizing,”
he added, as he saw how dry and stale the
bread and meat was. Of the cake, none remained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
but there was part of a very much crushed piece of
pie. Still, Jack was hungry, and he wished he had
more of the same kind of food.</p>

<p>The railroad ran for some distance along a high
embankment, across a low stretch of meadow, and
then it turned, bordering a country highway. Jack
decided it would be easier walking on the road
than along the ties, so he crossed over.</p>

<p>“It can’t be more than a couple of miles back,”
he said to himself. “My things will be pretty well
soaked, but I guess I can dry them out.”</p>

<p>As he went around a bend in the road, he came
to a place where another highway joined the one
on which he was traveling. At the same time he
saw, coming along the other road, a country lad,
driving a wagon, in which were a number of milk
cans. The youthful driver spied Jack.</p>

<p>“Want a lift?” he asked good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Thanks, but it depends on which way you are
going,” replied our hero.</p>

<p>“I’m going along this road,” was the answer,
and the lad pointed to the highway bordering the
track. “I’m taking this milk to the dairy,” he
added. “Ye can ride as far as I go.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess I will. I want to get to where
the railroad crosses the river, about two miles
back.”</p>

<p>“That’s the Wickatunk creek; that ain’t no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
river,” remarked the young milkman, “Goin’
fishin’ in it?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, you might call it that.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no fish in it, around here. About
three miles down is a good place, though.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to catch any fish,” said Jack, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Ye don’t? Then what in Tunket be ye goin’
fishin’ fer?”</p>

<p>“My dress-suit case.”</p>

<p>The boy, who had halted his horse, looked at
Jack sharply. Evidently he thought the stranger
was not quite sound in his mind.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” went on our hero, with a smile.
“My suit case toppled into the river as I was
riding over it in a freight car. I’m going back to
see if I can’t fish it out.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” remarked the other lad. “Well, come on
up, and I’ll drive ye there. I thought maybe ye
was jokin’.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s far from being a joke. I hope I get
it out. I need the clothes that are in it, though by
the time I get them they may look as badly as this
suit does,” and he glanced down at the one he
wore, which was wrinkled and dirty from his ride
in the freight car.</p>

<p>Jack got up on the seat beside the farmer lad,
and briefly told the circumstances of his loss, saying
nothing, however, about having run away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>He said he was traveling in the freight car because
he could not afford any other means of transportation,
which was true enough.</p>

<p>“I’ll help ye look,” volunteered the boy. “I’ve
got lots of time. I started fer th’ dairy early this
mornin’. Did yer satchel have anything heavy in
it, so’s it would sink?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. I’m afraid it wouldn’t
float very well, after the clothes got water-soaked.
Is the river very deep?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t a river, I tell ye. It’s a creek.”</p>

<p>“It looked like a river to me, and a mighty big
one, when I saw my case fall into it. Is the creek
very deep?”</p>

<p>“Not very; only in spots. It’s kinder deep
where th’ railroad bridge is.”</p>

<p>During the ride that followed, the two lads conversed
on various topics, Jack asking many questions
about the country in that vicinity. He made
cautious inquiries as to whether there was any
alarm out for his arrest, and found, to his relief,
that there was not.</p>

<p>Arriving at the bridge, the country lad, who said
his name was Ferd Armstrong, tied his horse, and
went down to the edge of the creek to help Jack
look for his property.</p>

<p>“That’s about where it fell in,” said Jack, throwing
a stone into the water as nearly as he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
at the spot where he had seen the case disappear.
“Maybe if I had a long pole I could fish it out.”</p>

<p>“I know a better way than that,” volunteered
Ferd.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Take off your shoes and stockings and wade in.
I’ll help ye.”</p>

<p>The boys did this, and soon were walking carefully
about in the creek, peering here and there
for a sight of the case. The stream was clear, and
they could see bottom almost everywhere. But
there was no sign of the flat valise.</p>

<p>“Th’ current must have carried it below th’
bridge,” suggested Ferd. “We’ll look there. But
don’t wade under th’ bridge. There’s deep holes
there, made by an eddy. It’s over yer head in one
place.”</p>

<p>They walked along the bank until they were below
the bridge, and then they resumed their search.
Jack got a long pole and poked it into places where
Ferd said it was too deep to wade, but their efforts
were fruitless. The dress-suit case had disappeared.</p>

<p>“It’s either been carried a long way downstream,
or else some one saw it and walked off with
it,” declared Jack. “Well, I suppose I’ll have to
do without it. But it’s tough luck.”</p>

<p>“Where ye goin’ now?” asked Ferd.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, exactly. I must get a place to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
work. Do you know of any farmers around here
who might hire me?”</p>

<p>“Dunno’s I do. They mostly have all th’ hired
men they need by now. Do ye know anythin’ about
milkin’ cows?”</p>

<p>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>“If ye did; dad might hire ye,” went on the
young farmer. “He needs a hand to milk cows.
Th’ last man we had left because a cow kicked
him.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t think I’d care for the place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! A cow kick ain’t nothin’. Their
feet is soft. A hoss hurts when he kicks ye,
though.”</p>

<p>“I should think he would. I don’t believe I care
to be kicked by either. Well, if you don’t think
there’s any chance to get work around here, I’ll
have to travel on,” and Jack spoke rather wearily.</p>

<p>“Ye might git a job at th’ dairy where I’m takin’
this milk,” went on Ferd. “They have lots of men
an’ boys. If you want, I’ll give ye a lift there, an’
ye kin ask. I know th’ foreman of th’ cheese department.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’ll try it. I’m afraid I have put you
to a lot of bother as it is.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks! That ain’t nothin’. I got up
early t’-day, an’ I’ve got lots of time. Usually I’m
two hours later than this bringin’ over th’ milk
from our place.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“What was your hurry this morning?”</p>

<p>“I want t’ git back quick, so’s I kin go t’ th’
circus. I ain’t been t’ one in two year.”</p>

<p>“Is there a circus coming here?” asked Jack, a
sudden idea coming into his mind.</p>

<p>“It’s comin’ t’ Mulford; that’s the next town.
It’s a dandy show. I seen th’ pictures. Be ye
goin’?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can, very well,” replied Jack,
though he did not say that the reason was because
he had no money. “I must look for a place to
work.”</p>

<p>“Maybe ye’ll git a job at th’ dairy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope I do, but if I should I couldn’t
leave it to go to a circus.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not. Waal, that’s hard luck.
G’lang there, Dobbin,” this last to his horse.
“Waal, I’m goin’. I’ve been savin’ up fer it over
three months. I’ve got a dollar an’ thirteen cents.
I kin git in fer half a dollar, an’ have sixty-three
cents t’ spend.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have a good time,” commented
Jack.</p>

<p>“Betcher boots I will! That’s what I got up so
early fer. Say,” Ferd added, as if a new thought
had come to him, “did ye have yer breakfast?”</p>

<p>“I had some breakfast,” replied Jack. He
hardly felt like calling it his regular morning meal.</p>

<p>“I jest happened t’ think they don’t serve meals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
in freight cars,” went on the country lad, with a
shrewd smile. “Say, how’d ye like a nice drink of
rich milk? Our cows give fine milk.”</p>

<p>“I’d like it very much,” answered Jack. “But
can you spare it?”</p>

<p>“Shucks, yes! I’ve got a hundred an’ sixty
quarts here in these cans. Wait; I’ll git ye a good
drink.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a cup or a glass,” objected Jack, “and
I’m afraid I can’t drink out of one of those cans.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fix it,” replied Ferd. He stopped the horse
and then, removing the top of one of the cans,
tilted the receptacle over until a stream of thick,
creamy milk flowed into the cover.</p>

<p>“There ye are,” he announced. “Drink that,
an’ it’ll make ye feel better.”</p>

<p>It certainly did. Jack thought it was the best
beverage he had ever had, not even excepting an
ice cream soda.</p>

<p>The ride was resumed, and soon they came in
sight of a series of low buildings.</p>

<p>“That’s the dairy,” announced Ferd. “Now
we’ll see if ye kin git a job there.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>JACK AT THE CIRCUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ferd</span> drove the wagon up to one of the buildings
where a low, broad platform opened into a room
with a concrete floor, about which stood many milk
cans. In one corner was a big tank, partly filled
with milk.</p>

<p>Jack was interested in what followed. Greeting
with a cheery “good morning” the man in charge,
Fred proceeded to lift out his cans of milk to
the platform of a scale.</p>

<p>“Do you weigh the milk?” asked Jack. “I
thought it went by measure.”</p>

<p>“We weigh it here,” answered the man.
“That’s the way they do at most dairies and cheese
factories.”</p>

<p>Ferd was given a ticket showing how much milk
he had delivered, and then turning his wagon
about, he drove to a pump that stood on a sort of
elevated tank, with a trough extending from it to
a height convenient for the vehicle.</p>

<p>“What you going to do now?” asked Jack.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Pump up some sour milk for th’ pigs,” replied
Ferd. “After that I’ll take you to th’ foreman
of the cheese factory.”</p>

<p>He stepped up to the pump and began to work
the handle.</p>

<p>“Jest hold that trough over one of th’ cans, will
ye?” he asked Jack.</p>

<p>Our hero did as directed, and, as the country
lad pumped, a stream of curdled milk flowed into
the cans that had just been emptied.</p>

<p>“This is what’s left after they take out th’
cream, or use th’ milk for cheese,” explained Ford.
“It’s fine fer pigs. Ours love it, an’ I take some
home every trip.”</p>

<p>He filled two cans with the refuse part of the
milk, and then, driving his horse out of the way of
any other farmers who might want to get some
of the sour milk for their pigs, for it was given
away by the dairy, Ferd invited Jack to accompany
him.</p>

<p>“I hope you git a job,” he remarked, in friendly
tones.</p>

<p>“So do I,” replied Jack. “But if I don’t get one
here I may land a place somewhere else,” for he
had a certain plan in his mind, though he did not
want to speak about it.</p>

<p>“Hey, Si,” called Ferd to a good-natured looking
man, who stood in the doorway of another low
building. “How be ye?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Pritty tol’able. How’s yerself?”</p>

<p>“Fine. I got up early t’ go t’ th’ circus. Here’s
a friend of mine. Can’t ye give him a job turnin’
cheeses?” For cheeses have to be turned around
quite often to “ripen” properly, and it is quite a
task in a dairy where they make hundreds of them.</p>

<p>“Waal, now, if you’d come yist’day I could ’a’
done it,” replied Silas Martin, who was foreman
of the cheese department. “But we put a feller on
last night, an’ there ain’t no place now.”</p>

<p>“Is there any other opening here?” asked Jack,
speaking for himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is,” replied the foreman.
“I’d be glad to give you a place if I had one, but
I can’t. Do you like cheese?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m quite fond of it,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Come in and I’ll give you some that’s nice and
mild,” went on Mr. Martin. “Want t’ take some
home, Ferd? Your daddy likes it. It’s full
cream, and it’s just right.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Jack’s new friend.</p>

<p>The two boys went into the cheese room, which
smelled quite appetizing. The foreman gave them
each large portions of cheese, wrapped in paper.</p>

<p>“This will help out on my meals,” thought Jack.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” called Mr. Martin, as the
boys were about to leave. “There’s suthin’ that
allers goes with cheese. Can ye guess what it is?”
he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Crackers?” replied our hero questioningly.</p>

<p>“Crackers is one thing, an’ apple pie’s another.
My wife put me up a lunch this mornin’ an’ I guess
she thought I must have a terrible appetite. I’ve
got more’n I want.”</p>

<p>He went to a closet and came back with some
crisp crackers, and two large pieces of pie, which
he insisted that the boys take.</p>

<p>“I’ve got twice as much left as I kin eat,” he
said.</p>

<p>Jack accepted his portion with many thanks,
and Ferd put his in one of his big pockets. When
he got outside he said to Jack:</p>

<p>“Say, I ain’t got no use fer this. I had a hearty
breakfast, and I’ll have a bully dinner before I go
to th’ circus. Take this.”</p>

<p>He handed over his cheese, pie, and crackers.</p>

<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Sure not. It might come in handy fer you if
ye—if ye ain’t got no money.”</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly haven’t any money, and I’ll
take this very gladly, if you don’t want it.”</p>

<p>“Naw. I don’t want it. Say, if ye’ll come
back with me I’ll see that ye git a good dinner.”</p>

<p>“I’m ever so much obliged to you,” replied
Jack. “But I think I’ll go on. If I thought I
could get a job at your farm I’d go with you, but
I know nothing about milking or work about cows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
and horses. I think I’ll travel on. But I want to
thank you for what you’ve done for me.”</p>

<p>“Aw, that’s all right,” responded Ferd. “I
wish I could ’a’ helped ye find th’ satchel thet fell
in th’ creek.”</p>

<p>“So do I, but I guess it’s gone.”</p>

<p>Bidding good-by to the kind and hospitable
farm lad, Jack, who had inquired the shortest way
to Mulford, set out for that town, carrying the
food supplies which had so unexpectedly been
given him.</p>

<p>“Luck is beginning to turn my way,” he
thought. “When I get to where the circus is I’m
going to try and get a job there.”</p>

<p>It was quite a tramp to Mulford, and it was
noon when Jack came in sight of the town, which
lay in a sheltered valley. He could see the white
tents of the circus, gay with many colored flags,
and his heart beat faster, as does that of every boy
when he nears the scene where one of the canvas-sheltered
shows hold forth.</p>

<p>Though it was early, there was quite a crowd
about, watching the men erect some of the smaller
tents, arranging the wagons, or cooking the dinner
for the performers and helpers.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll eat my lunch, and then look about,”
decided Jack. The crackers, cheese, and pie tasted
most excellent, and when he had taken a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
drink from a spring, which served to supply the
circus, he felt in shape to look about for a job.</p>

<p>He strolled over to where a gang of men were
putting up a tent. Something seemed to be going
wrong, and the man in charge was out of patience.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you gazaboos?” he
asked tartly. “You pull on the wrong rope every
time. Here, haul on the other one, I tell you!
What’s the matter with you? Do you want this
tent to get up to-day or some time next week?
Yank on that other rope, I tell you! Good land!
You’re worse than a lot of monkeys! Pull on that
short rope!” he fairly yelled.</p>

<p>The particular man at whom he was directing
his remarks did not appear to understand. He
pulled on a long rope, instead of a short one, and
the tent, which was nearly up, was about to fall
down. Jack saw what was wanted. He sprang
forward, and, just in time to save the big stretch
of canvas from collapsing, he hauled on the proper
rope, pulling it into place.</p>

<p>“That’s what I wanted,” said the man in
charge. “It’s a pity you fellers wouldn’t take lessons
off that lad. He don’t need a tent-stake hammer
to have sense knocked into his head. Hold
that rope a minute, sonny, and I’ll come over there
and fasten it. I never see such a lot of dumb
idiots in all my born days!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>Jack held the rope until the man took it from
him, and fastened it properly.</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you,” he said gratefully
to our hero. “Only for you the whole blamed
business would have been on the ground.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome,” answered Jack. Then a
sudden idea came to him. “You don’t want any
more helpers, do you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I do need a couple of hands,” was the
rather unexpected answer. “If you want to stick
around, and help out, I’ll give you a couple of
tickets to the show.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” replied Jack, for he had a further
scheme he wanted to try and this just fitted in
with it.</p>

<p>“All right,” spoke the man in charge of the
tents. “Come with me. I’ll find something for
you to do.”</p>

<p>Jack was soon engaged in helping put up other
tents, in carrying gasoline torches here and there,
filling them, and getting ready for the night performance,
though the afternoon one had not yet
been held. Several times the man who had engaged
him came around to see how he was getting
on.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, kid,” he said heartily.
“You’ll do. I wish I had a few more like you.
Here, just take this note over to the ticket wagon.
Tell the man Ike Landon, the boss canvasman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
sent you. He’ll give you a couple of good seats.
I guess you can knock off now. We’re in pretty
good shape.”</p>

<p>He scribbled something on a piece of paper and
handed it to Jack, who took it over to the ticket
wagon. It was drawing close to the time for the
performance, and there was quite a throng in front
of the gaudily painted vehicle.</p>

<p>As Jack was working his way through the press
to the window, he heard a familiar voice ask:</p>

<p>“Waal, are ye goin’ to th’ show? Thought ye
didn’t have no money.”</p>

<p>“Why, Ferd,” exclaimed Jack, recognizing his
friend of the milk wagon. “I’m glad to see you,”
he went on. “Have you bought your ticket yet?”</p>

<p>“Nope, but I’m goin’ to.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, then. I can get two, and I’ll
give you one.”</p>

<p>“Two? How ye goin’ to git two?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>By this time Jack had managed to reach the
window. He handed in the note, saying:</p>

<p>“Ike Landon, the boss canvasman, sent me with
that.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” replied the ticket man, as he
glanced at the piece of paper. “Here are a couple
of reserved seats.”</p>

<p>“Say, ye’re a peach!” exclaimed Ferd admiringly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
when Jack gave him one of the pasteboard
slips. “How’d ye do it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I pulled the right rope in time,” replied
Jack, as he and his new friend went inside the tent,
where the band was playing a lively air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>JACK DOES A STUNT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Say</span>, ain’t this bully!” exclaimed Ferd, as the
procession which begins each circus performance
wound slowly around the arena. “It’s immense!
I wouldn’t ’a’ missed it fer a lot. I’m glad I met
you. Now I’ve got half a dollar more to spend
on stuff to eat. Besides, this is a better seat than
I would ’a’ got.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the seats are all right,” admitted Jack.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you hungry?” went on Ferd, though he
did not take his eyes off the procession of animals,
chariots and performers. “I am,” he continued,
not waiting for an answer. “Let’s have some hot
frankfurter sandwiches.”</p>

<p>A man with a basket of them was passing
among the audience. Jack eyed the brown sausages,
in between the white rolls, with a hungry
eye. The crackers, cheese, and pie had not been
very “filling.”</p>

<p>“Hey, there! Give us some of them,” called
Ferd to the man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“How many? Speak quick. I’ve got to get out
of here in a hurry, before the performance begins,”
replied the vender.</p>

<p>“Four,” replied the farmer boy. “Ye can eat
two, can’t ye?” he inquired of Jack, who nodded
his head in assent.</p>

<p>“Say, these are all right,” remarked the runaway
lad, as he munched the meat and bread, on
which had been spread a liberal quantity of mustard.
“I’m glad I met you, Ferd.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re even. But here comes the acrobats.
I like to watch ’em,” he added, as the procession
came to an end, amid a blare of trumpets,
and the show proper began.</p>

<p>It was like any other traveling circus, better
than some, but not as good as the large ones, even
though the gaudy posters did announce that the
“Combined Bower &amp; Brewster Aggregation of
Monster Menagerie, Hippodrome, Amphitheatre
and Colossal Exhibition challenged comparison
with any similar amusement enterprise in the entire
world.”</p>

<p>“Look at that clown!” exclaimed Ferd. “Why,
there’s a whole lot of ’em,” he added. “Gosh!
but this is great! I never saw such a good show!
I don’t know which way to look!”</p>

<p>In fact, so many things were going on at the
same time that it was difficult to select any particular
feature for observation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>There were men and women on high trapezes,
others doing balancing feats on elevated platforms,
still others performing on the backs of
horses, while in a ring near the two boys ten elephants
were being put through their paces.</p>

<p>Jack had often been to a circus before, and now,
from a reason for which he could hardly account,
he paid particular attention to the antics of the
clowns.</p>

<p>“I believe I could do as good as some of them,
with a little practice,” he thought. “What is
needed is some sort of funny stunt to make the
people laugh. It doesn’t much matter what it is,
as long as it’s funny.”</p>

<p>The clowns did seem to cause considerable
laughter. Some of them had trained dogs, pigs or
roosters which they used in their act. Others had
a partner who aided them in provoking smiles or
shouts of glee. Some did acrobatic stunts, some
sang or danced, and one, with the help of a companion,
acted as a barber using a whitewash brush
to spread the lather on his partner’s face.</p>

<p>“This is the kind of life that would suit me for
a while,” said Jack to himself. “I’d like to travel
with a circus, and I believe I could do as good as
some of those clowns, if I had a chance. What’s
more, I’m going to try for a job here. I’ll ask the
boss canvasman if there isn’t a chance. I’d just
like to be with the show, and maybe I could earn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
enough money in the season to pay my way to
China, and see what has happened to my folks.”</p>

<p>This thought so occupied Jack that he paid little
attention to the performance. He made up his
mind he would seek out one of the managers, as
soon as the show was over, and make his request.</p>

<p>“Say! Look at that! Did ye see it?” suddenly
exclaimed Ferd.</p>

<p>“See what?”</p>

<p>“Why, that man jumped over ten elephants in a
line!”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty good,” remarked Jack indifferently.</p>

<p>“Pretty good? I should say it was. I’d like
to see you do it.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll do it,” spoke Jack, who had just
arrived at a certain decision.</p>

<p>“What? Jump over ten elephants?” asked his
companion, in astonishment. “Say, are you
dreamin’?”</p>

<p>“That’s right; I guess I was,” admitted Jack,
with a laugh. “I was thinking about something
else.”</p>

<p>“Guess you don’t care much about a circus,”
said Ferd.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking too much of getting a job,” replied
Jack.</p>

<p>Ferd shook his head as if he could not understand
Jack’s indifference. After the performance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the farm boy wanted to treat Jack to popcorn,
soda, and more frankfurters. Jack declined
everything but the sausage sandwiches.</p>

<p>“I can save them to eat when I’m hungry,” he
said in explanation. “I may need a meal to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come home and stay with me
a few days?” suggested Ferd. “My folks
wouldn’t care, and maybe you could get a job
somewhere in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>Jack thanked his new friend, but said he had
other plans. A little later he parted from Ferd,
and, by inquiring, he found the boss canvasman,
who was taking a rest after his labors in superintending
the erection of the tents.</p>

<p>Jack explained what he wanted—an introduction
to the manager, who had charge of hiring the
performers.</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll take you to him,” replied Ike Landon,
“only I don’t believe you can do anything he’d
want. Circus performers have to train for a good
while.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I can do something to earn a
little,” replied Jack. “Where will I find the manager?
What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“His name is Jim Paine, and he’s a strict manager,
let me tell you. But if you make good, why,
he’s all right. Come on over and I’ll introduce
you to him.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Jack followed the canvasman across the circus
grounds, from which most of the audience had
gone. Preparations were already under way for
the evening performance.</p>

<p>“Mr. Paine, here’s a lad who wants to join our
circus,” remarked Landon, with a grin, as he presented
Jack. “He did me a good turn this morning,
and I’d like to help him if I could.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum!” exclaimed the manager, looking
at Jack sharply. The runaway noticed that Mr.
Paine was a very pompous sort of person. He
wore a red vest, with yellow spots on it, a big red
tie, in which sparkled a large stone, and he had
an immense watch chain.</p>

<p>Jack wondered if the manager was not going
to say anything more than “Ha! Hum!” But
presently the big man made another remark.</p>

<p>“What can you do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, not very much, perhaps,” replied Jack.
“I’d like to learn to be a clown, but I’d be willing
to knock around and do almost anything for a
while, until I learned the business.”</p>

<p>“Run away from home?” asked the manager
snappily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jack quickly, determined to tell
as much as was necessary of what had happened.</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum! First time I ever knew a boy
who had run away from home to admit it,” spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the manager. “You deserve credit for that, anyway.
What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>Thereupon Jack told of the unjust accusation of
the old professor, and what had happened to him
since he had left Westville.</p>

<p>“So you want to be a clown, eh?” said the manager
when Jack’s story was finished. “Had any
training?”</p>

<p>“I used to take the part in amateur shows me
and my chums got up, and I did a stunt on a vaudeville
stage one night.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see what you can do?”</p>

<p>Jack’s heart beat fast. Here was the very
chance he wanted. Could he “make good?” So
much depended on the first impression.</p>

<p>“Is there a place where I can make-up?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Make-up? Do you know how to make-up?”</p>

<p>“A little bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, if Ike Landon says you helped him, you
must be all right, for he’s a hard man to please.
If you’re going to have a try-out, you might as
well do it proper. You can go to the dressing-tent.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Right over there,” and the manager pointed.
“Ike will show you. Tell Sam Kyle to give him
a hand,” the manager called after the boss canvasman.
“I’ll wait here for him,” he added.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Say, you’re in luck,” said Ike. “It ain’t many
he’d give such a chance to. Do you know what
you’re going to do?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>Jack was introduced to a small, fat man, who,
in the men’s dressing-tent, was busy washing the
red and white paint off his face.</p>

<p>“Sam is the head clown,” explained the canvasman.
“He’s been in the business—let’s see, how
long is it now, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Forty years this season. I was one of the first
clowns that Barnum ever hired. You’ll find some
grease paint over there,” he added to Jack; and
then he and the canvasman began to talk about
matters connected with the circus, paying no more
attention to the runaway lad.</p>

<p>Jack was quite nervous, but he made-up after
an original idea of his own. He turned his coat
and vest wrongside out, and, with the aid of Ike,
put them on backwards. Then, feeling rather
foolish over what he was about to do, he stepped
from the dressing-tent and walked over to where
the manager had said he would wait for him.</p>

<p>Several of the performers who saw Jack emerge
laughed at his curious costume and “make-up.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must look funny, no matter how I
feel,” he said. “I hope I can do my funny dance.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum!” exclaimed the manager, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
saw Jack. “That’s not so bad. Let’s see what
you can do.”</p>

<p>A crowd of performers, and some of the circus
helpers, gathered in a ring about the boy.
Then Jack began. He repeated some of the
things he had done in the theatre at home, but
added to them. He sang, he danced, and cut all
sorts of capers, gaining more and more confidence
in himself as he heard the crowd laughing. He
even detected a smile on the rather grim face of
the manager.</p>

<p>Then, to cap his performance, Jack caught up a
couple of paper-covered hoops, or rings, similar
to those through which some of the performers
jumped from the backs of running horses. Holding
these under his arms, like a pair of wings, he
began to imitate a clumsy bird. He hopped up on
a board that rested across a saw-horse, and, from
that elevation, pretended to fly to the ground, but
doing it so grotesquely that he stepped through
both hoops and was all tangled up in them.</p>

<p>This produced some hearty laughs, and one or
two of the women performers applauded, for Ike
had whispered to them what Jack’s trial meant.</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum! Not so bad,” remarked the manager,
though his voice was not very cordial.
“That imitation flying was well done. That
might be worked up. I think we can use another
clown, as I’m one short. I’ll engage you, young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
man. You’ll get ten dollars a week, and your
board, of course. Can you come right on the
road?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum! Well, perhaps we can work you
into shape. You need some practice, but it’s not
so bad; it’s not so bad. You can consider yourself
engaged. Report to Sam Kyle.”</p>

<p>Jack could hardly believe his good luck. An
hour before he had not known where his next meal
was coming from. Now he was engaged as a
clown in a large circus.</p>

<small>PLANNING AN ACT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Say</span>,” remarked Ike Landon, when Jack had
made his way through the little ring of performers,
“you did better than I thought you would.
The old man—I mean the boss—is mighty hard to
please. If you attend strictly to business now,
there’s no reason why you can’t become a first-class
performer.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try,” said Jack. “I need the
money for a particular purpose, for I’m determined
to locate my folks if I can. I’ll do my
best.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Sam to give you a few pointers. He
knows the business from A to Z, backwards and
forwards, and he isn’t jealous of a new performer
like lots of ’em in this game. You stick to Sam
and you’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I can perform to-night?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe so. Ask Sam.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Jack found the head clown eating his early supper
in the big dining-tent.</p>

<p>“Sit down and eat with me,” invited Mr. Kyle,
when Ike had related the result of the runaway’s
trial. “I don’t like to cut up capers on a full
stomach,” he went on, “so I eat early. Well, I
hear you made good.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Paine seemed to like what I did, though
I don’t know that it was very funny,” replied Jack
modestly.</p>

<p>“It’s not so easy to make people laugh,” spoke
the old clown. “I’ve known elaborate acts to fall
as flat as a pancake, and, again, some simple little
thing would bring roars of laughter. It all depends
on how it’s done. I’ve been at it forty
years, and I’ve still got things to learn.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s a good thing to have a specialty?”
asked Jack, as he began to eat of the plain
but wholesome food which a waiter set before him.</p>

<p>“The best thing in the world. My specialty is
taking the part of animals, and I may say I’ve
been quite successful. If you can get up a novel
act, something that’s up-to-date, and which will
hit the popular fancy, you’re all right.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kyle spoke quite seriously, and it seemed
rather odd to see him thus, when Jack remembered
what a queer figure he had presented while
in the ring, attired as a big rooster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“I was thinking of getting up some special act,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Sam quickly. “You
want to be careful of one thing,” he went on.
“Don’t try to imitate any of the other clowns. If
you do they’ll get down on you. Besides, one act
of a kind is enough. What were you thinking of
trying?”</p>

<p>“I thought some stunt that had to do with a
flying machine wouldn’t be bad,” replied Jack.
“You know there’s so much of that going on now
that the public is interested. I might get up something
to look like an airship, pretend to fly in it,
and come tumbling down. Do you think that
would take?”</p>

<p>“It might. At any rate, it wouldn’t be any harm
to try.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering how I could get a make-believe
airship made.”</p>

<p>“Why, Pete Delafield, the property man, will
help you out if you ask him. He makes all the
things the other clowns and I use in our acts. Of
course you can’t get it for to-night, though.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I don’t expect to. I’ll have to plan it
out, and think up how I’m going to act. Where
can I find Mr. Delafield?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you to him after we finish eating.
You’ll go on to-night, won’t you?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Mr. Paine didn’t say anything about it, but
I’d like to, if you think I’m good enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t much matter at night. You can
go out in the ring when I go, and do your stunt.
Even if the audience doesn’t laugh at you, you’ll
gain confidence, so when you’re ready with your
airship act you’ll not be afraid.”</p>

<p>“That will be a good idea,” replied Jack. “I’m
much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I’ll go with you to Pete
Delafield in a minute.”</p>

<p>While Mr. Kyle was finishing his second cup of
coffee, a stout man, whose manner at once proclaimed
that he was inclined to be nervous and
fussy, approached.</p>

<p>“I say, Sam,” he began. “What do you think
of this? ‘A Death-Defying Double Dive Down a
Dangerous, Darksome, Decapitated Declivity.’
That’s to advertise the new bicycle ride down a
broken incline, which we’re going to spring next
week. How does that sound to you?”</p>

<p>“I’d say ‘descent’ instead of ‘dive,’” suggested
Mr. Kyle. “There’s no water in it, is there?”</p>

<p>“No, but I might have ’em put a tank under it.
But I guess you’re right. I’ll change it,” and he
hurried away, writing as he went on a bit of paper,
and murmuring to himself: “Death-Defying Descent
Down,” etc. Jack looked at the head clown,
as if asking who the man was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“That’s Nolan Waddleton, our adjective man,”
said Mr. Kyle.</p>

<p>“The adjective man?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He gets up all the big words to describe
the special acts and attractions. Maybe he’ll be
putting yours in big type on the posters some
day.”</p>

<p>“Not much hope of that.”</p>

<p>“You never can tell, my boy. You may make
a big hit. I hope you do. But come on, now,
we’ll go see the property man.”</p>

<p>Jack was introduced to Mr. Delafield, who
agreed to make Jack as good an imitation of a
small airship as possible, provided the boy would
describe what he wanted.</p>

<p>“I’ll have it for you the middle of next week,”
he said. “I’ve got to make a fake automobile for
Ted Chester,” he added to Mr. Kyle.</p>

<p>“Is Ted going to do an auto stunt?” asked the
head clown. “That’s pretty stale now.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ted thinks he can freshen it up. It’s
none of my affair. I’m here to obey orders.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, but I don’t believe Ted will make
a hit with an auto. He had one last season, and
the people are sort of getting tired of them.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say, but you can’t convince
Ted.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not. Well, Jack, come on over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
to my tent, and I’ll give you a few pointers about
to-night. I want to see you make good,” and the
kind old clown led our hero over to the rehearsing
tent, a part of which was screened off for his own
use.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>HIS FIRST PERFORMANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> was more nervous than he had thought
he would be when he got ready for his first performance
that evening. Under Mr. Kyle’s direction
he painted his face, and then he donned a suit
belonging to a clown who had left the circus because
of ill health.</p>

<p>“Well, you look, as good as the average clown,”
said Jack’s friend when the boy was fully attired.
“Now, it’s what you do that will count to-night,
and until you get your new act. Then you may
find it easier to make a hit. Don’t be nervous.
You may think all in the tent are looking at you,
but they’re not. Go ahead just as if you were doing
it for Mr. Paine. He’s the one that counts,
for if he doesn’t like your act he’ll discharge you.”</p>

<p>“I hope I can do as well as I did this afternoon,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, you will, I’m sure. Just remember what
I told you. When you speak, speak slowly and
distinctly. A falsetto voice carries a good distance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
I used to be able to manage one, but I
can’t any more. I’m too old. But you can.”</p>

<p>There was a glamour about the circus at night
that was absent in the daytime. Under the flickering
gasolene torches the dingiest suit looked fine,
and the spangles sparkled as they never would in
the sun.</p>

<p>The band struck up a lively air. Once more the
procession of performers and animals paraded
around the big tent. Jack felt his heart beating
loudly. So far he only saw the bright side of the
circus life. It was all gaiety and excitement to
him now. But he was soon to know the other
and darker side.</p>

<p>“We’ll go on in a minute, now,” said Sam Kyle
to Jack. “You certainly know how to make up
well. Lots of clowns take a year to learn that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kyle was adjusting a long black patch over
one eye, making his appearance more grotesque
than before. Suddenly the band stopped playing.
The last of the procession, having finished the circuit,
wound out of the ring. Then came a blare
of trumpets.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Sam, and he ran from the
dressing-tent into the big canvas-covered arena,
where the performance had started. Other clowns
followed him, and a score of additional performers—acrobats,
tumblers and tight-rope walkers—ran
out. Jack followed more slowly. This was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
be the real test. He wondered how he would succeed.</p>

<p>He decided he would repeat the same thing he
had done for the manager that afternoon. He had
secured several of the paper-covered hoops, and
he resolved to give as odd an imitation of a man
trying to fly as possible.</p>

<p>Once he had passed beyond the canvas curtain
that shut off the dressing-tent from the main one,
Jack beheld a scene that he long remembered. In
the light of the big gasolene torches, high up on
the tent poles, he saw many performers going
through their acts. There came to his nostrils the
smell of freshly-turned earth that formed the ring
banks, the damp sawdust, the odor of wild animals,
the stifling whiff of gasolene. He heard the
music of the band, the shouts of the ringmasters,
the high, shrill laughter of the clowns. And he
heard other sounds. They were the merry shouts
and applause of the big audience.</p>

<p>For there was a large throng present. Jack
looked about on the sloping banks of people.
Their faces showed curiously white and their eyes
oddly black in the brilliant lights. Jack’s mind
was in a whirl.</p>

<p>But he was suddenly roused from his daze by
a sharp voice calling to him.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with you? Going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
stand there all day? What are you paid for?
Get busy! Do something!”</p>

<p>Then came the sharp crack of a whip, and Jack
jumped, for the end of the lash had caught him
on the legs, which were but thinly protected with
his cotton clown suit.</p>

<p>“Jump lively!” cried the voice, and Jack turned
to see Otto Mitz, the ringmaster, in his dress-suit
and white gloves, waving his long whip. Once
more the lash came curling toward Jack, but he
jumped aside in time to avoid it. There was a
laugh from that portion of the audience in front
of which he stood. Doubtless they thought it was
part of the show.</p>

<p>With anger in his heart at the man who had
been so needlessly cruel, Jack broke into a little
run. Though he had not known it, he was suffering
a little bit from “stage fright.” The ringmaster
had cured him of it. The boy felt a fierce
desire to make the people laugh heartily—to show
that he could “make good.”</p>

<p>He began his antics. Selecting a portion of the
large outer ring where there were no other clowns,
Jack did a funny dance, interspersed with snatches
of songs, though the band rather interfered with
this. Then seeing a board and a saw-horse near
him, he put them into place, so that he might jump
from the end of the plank, in his pretended flying
act.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Flapping the big paper hoops, as a bird does
its wings, Jack leaped from the end of the springboard.
He tangled himself all up in the rings, one
coming around his neck and the other encircling
his legs. Then flapping his arms like the sails of
an old-fashioned windmill, he trotted off amid the
laughter and applause of the throng.</p>

<p>He had been told by Sam Kyle that all the
clowns repeated their acts four times, in different
parts of the ring, so that the entire audience might
see them. Bearing this in mind, Jack prepared to
go through the same stunt a little farther along.
He succeeded even better than at first, and his
funny antics earned him loud applause.</p>

<p>“Ha! hum! Not so bad,” murmured a voice
near him, as he finished his second attempt. He
looked up and saw Mr. Paine.</p>

<p>“Keep it up, my boy,” said the manager. “I
guess you’ll do.”</p>

<p>Jack was grateful for the praise, and almost
forgot the mean ringmaster, though his leg still
smarted where the lash had struck him.</p>

<p>But if Jack thought he was to have such an
easy time winning success, he was mistaken. He
was going through his turn for the fourth and
last time when, just as he “flew” from the end
of the board, Ted Chester came along, doing a
stunt in a miniature automobile in which he sat,
propelling it with his feet. Unfortunately, Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
landed right in front of the other clown, who ran
into him, upsetting himself and overturning the
auto.</p>

<p>This time the crowd applauded more heartily
than ever. They thought it was done purposely.
Jack arose, trying to untangle himself from the
paper hoops, in which he found himself fastened
differently than at any time before. He was surprised
to see Ted Chester glaring at him.</p>

<p>“You did that on purpose!” exclaimed the older
clown in a low voice. “You wanted to spoil my
act.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. It was an accident,” replied
Jack, rubbing his shin where he had struck it on
the small auto.</p>

<p>“I say you did! I’ll fix you! I’ll complain to
Mr. Paine, that’s what I’ll do. I’m not going to
the trouble of getting up a good act to have a
green kid like you put it on the blink. Get out
of my way or I’ll punch your head. I’ll get even
with you for this,” and he shook his fist in Jack’s
face.</p>

<p>The audience took this for part of a pre-arranged
act, and shouted their approval at the quarrel
between the two clowns. This made Ted
madder than ever.</p>

<p>“I’ll have you fired!” he exclaimed as he righted
the auto and started off with it. “I’ll not work
in a ring where there are such clumsy dolts as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
you. What’s the profession coming to when they
take in green kids that don’t know anything about
acting? But you won’t be with the show to-morrow,
I’ll guarantee that!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to interfere with you,” said Jack.
“It was an accident.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve heard that story before,” sneered
Ted. “You wanted to spoil my act. You’re jealous
of me because I get the most applause. So are
the other clowns. I shouldn’t wonder but what
some of ’em put you up to it. But I’ll get square
with you and them, too.”</p>

<p>“Nobody put me up to it. It was an accident,”
insisted the young clown, but Ted, without answering,
made his way to the dressing-tent.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>JACK HAS ENEMIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> circus performance was almost over. They
were getting ready for the chariot and other races
which would bring the program to an end. Jack
went to the tent where he had made-up as a clown.
He found scores of the men performers getting
off their ring outfits and putting on their regular
garments. The clowns were washing off the grease
paint.</p>

<p>“There he is now!” exclaimed a voice as Jack
entered the tent. “There’s the fresh kid that
spoiled my act. He did it on purpose, too. If I
find out who put him up to it——”</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Jack, who intended to
maintain his rights. “You needn’t say that, for
it isn’t so. I’ve told you it was an accident.”</p>

<p>“Well, I say it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“What’s the row?” asked Sam Kyle, coming into
the tent after a burst of applause had testified
to his abilities as an entertainer. “What’s up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Ted? You seem angry, my child,” and he assumed
a playful, theatrical air.</p>

<p>“Cut that out!” replied Ted in a surly tone.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are peevish, little one,” went on Sam,
who was a great joker, outside as well as inside
the ring.</p>

<p>“Ted says the new kid spoiled his auto act,”
remarked a clown whose specialty was to lead a
little dog about the ring with a rope big enough
to hold a battleship fastened on the beast’s neck.</p>

<p>“That’s what he did,” spoke Ted. “He jumped
right down on me with those paper hoops, and
spoiled my act.”</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” put in Jack hotly.</p>

<p>“We’ll see what Mr. Paine thinks,” went on
Ted wrathfully. “I’m going to report to him.”</p>

<p>“You’ll report to me first,” declared Sam. “I’m
in charge of this part of the show. Jack, let’s hear
your story.”</p>

<p>Without stopping to remove his clown dress,
Jack told exactly what had happened, and how
the thing had occurred so quickly that it had been.</p>

<p>“Now it’s your turn,” said the head clown to
Ted, and the latter made it appear that it was
Jack’s fault. Some of the other performers, however,
had seen what had taken place, and their
version made it clear that it was an accident.</p>

<p>“You can report to Mr. Paine if you want to,”
said Sam, when he had declared that he believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
our hero, “but that’s all the good it will do. Jack
stays.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he does, eh?” replied Ted. “We’ll see
about that.”</p>

<p>But he did not go to Mr. Paine, for which Jack
was grateful, for the boy thought perhaps, in spite
of Sam Kyle being his friend, the manager might
discharge him.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind Ted,” said the head clown as he
took Jack aside and showed him how best to remove
the grease paint from his face. “He thinks
every performer is trying to spoil his act. He’s
jealous, that’s all. But look out for him. He’ll
try to make trouble for you, and he has an ugly
temper. Keep away from that part of the ring
where he is, and you’ll get along all right. I
watched you to-night. You did pretty well. Keep
at it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied Jack gratefully. “I think I
can do a better act when I get my flying machine.
Where do we show next?”</p>

<p>“At Haddington. That’s a big city. But you’d
better hustle, now, and get to the train.”</p>

<p>Jack finished removing his make-up, and then
donned his street clothes. He was given a trunk
by Sam, in which to put his clown outfit and some
tubes of grease paint. So far his baggage was
very light.</p>

<p>“Come on with me and I’ll see that you get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
place in the sleeping-car,” said Sam, for the Bower
&amp; Brewster Show had its own special train, with
quarters for the hundreds of performers, employees
and animals.</p>

<p>Outside the dressing-tent Jack found that very
little of the circus remained. The menagerie had
entirely disappeared, and now men were beginning
to take down the big tent. It was quite a
different scene from the one of an hour before.
Then it had been light, lively and gay, with strains
of music and the laughter of the crowd.</p>

<p>Now it was dark; on all sides were rumbling
wagons drawn by struggling horses, and men were
shouting and calling to one another, trying to get
their vehicles loaded so they could drive them to
the flatcars by which they were transported. Yet
though there was seeming confusion, everything
was done by a careful system.</p>

<p>Jack found that the interior of the sleeping-car
was not much like the regular Pullmans. But
it answered the purpose, and he soon followed the
example of the other circus performers and
crawled into his bunk. He was tired, yet the excitement
of what he had gone through kept him
awake. Then, too, there were many disturbing
noises caused by making up the train and loading
the big wagons containing the tents, poles, supplies
and animal cages.</p>

<p>Gentle snores on all sides of him told Jack that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
his companions were not disturbed by what, to
him, were unusual things, for they fell asleep almost
as soon as their heads touched the pillows.
Finally sharp whistles of the locomotives told him
that the train was ready to start, and soon he felt
himself being lulled to slumber by the motion of
the car and the steady click-clack as the wheels
passed over the rail joints.</p>

<p>He was roused from his sleep by some one
shaking him, and he looked up to see the good-natured
face of Sam Kyle looking in on him.</p>

<p>“Time for breakfast,” announced the head
clown.</p>

<p>“Breakfast? Is there a dining-car on the
train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for the manager and the star performers,
but we’ll take ours in the tent.”</p>

<p>“The tent? I thought—why—are we at the
next place where we’re going to show?”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” answered Sam. “Come on.
It’s only a short walk to the grounds, and if you
don’t hustle there may be no steak left.”</p>

<p>Jack looked from the window of his berth. He
saw that the train was in a railroad yard, and
from the flatcars men were sliding down the big
animal cages.</p>

<p>He hurriedly dressed, made his toilet in the
washroom of the car, and went out to find Sam
waiting for him. They were soon at the circus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
grounds, and the boy clown saw a crowd of men
laying out the canvas for the big tent. The animal
tent was already up, as was the dining one. While
Jack had been sleeping the circus employees had
been busy at work.</p>

<p>Many performers were arriving from the train,
and there was an appetizing smell of coffee and
meat on the fresh morning air. Gathered about
were scores of small boys, and Jack remembered
the time when he, as a little lad, used to get up
early to see the circus come in. Men were leading
the camels and elephants to water, hundreds of
horses were being driven here and there, there
was the rumble of heavy wagons containing tents
and poles, the deeper thunder of the wheels of
the chariots and gilded cages that went in the
street parade, the sound of men yelling and shouting—seemingly
confusion added to confusion.
Yet slowly order was coming out of disorder.</p>

<p>“Come on,” advised Sam. “There’s a good
meal waiting for us, and we don’t want to be left.”</p>

<p>Jack followed his friend toward the dining-tent.
As he passed the heavy cage containing the hippopotamus,
he heard a man, concealed on one side
of it, saying:</p>

<p>“He says it was an accident, but I know better.
Some one put him up to it. I’ll spoil his act the
first chance I get. I’ll be even with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll help you,” spoke another voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
and then Jack saw Otto Mitz, the ringmaster, and
Ted Chester walking away.</p>

<p>Jack had made two mean enemies since joining
the circus, and through no fault of his own,
for though he could understand why the clown
should bear him a grudge, from not understanding
how the accident had occurred, he saw no reason
for the ringmaster holding enmity against him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>THE FLYING MACHINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Breakfast</span> was a much better meal than Jack
had expected, from knowing the hurried manner
in which it must have had to be prepared and
under what adverse circumstances. But he was to
learn that a circus cannot afford not to feed its
employees and performers well, and that the
preparation and cooking of meals had been reduced
to a science. Large stoves were carried on
wagons, the sides of which dropped down, making
a regular kitchen. Soup was cooked in immense
caldrons, and the supplies, which had been contracted
for in advance, the bread, meat, milk, vegetables,
as well as fodder for the animals, had been
brought to the circus grounds by local dealers before
daylight.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we’ve had good weather this week,”
observed Sam as he finished his third cup of coffee.</p>

<p>“Why? Did it rain much before I joined?”
asked Jack, feeling somewhat of a veteran already,
though it was only his second day with the show.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Did it? Well, I should crack my grease
paint!” Which was the clown’s way of remarking
that he should smile. “It rained for three days
straight.”</p>

<p>“And you have to show in the rain, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Rain or shine, we go on. Only it’s not much
fun. It’s cold and dreary, and the crowds don’t
laugh worth a cent. The sunshine for mine, every
time.”</p>

<p>Jack wondered whether he had better tell his
friend what he had overheard near the hippopotamus
wagon, but he decided he had better try to
fight his own battles, or, at least, wait until he
needed help against the schemes of his enemies.</p>

<p>For Jack was convinced that Ted Chester would
endeavor to do him some injury. If not a physical
one, the vindictive clown would probably try
to interfere with Jack when the boy was doing
his turn in the ring. This would cause him to fail
to make the audience laugh, and he might get discharged.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep away from the side of the ring where
Ted is,” thought the young clown. “I suppose I’ve
got to be on the watch against that ringmaster,
too. His whip certainly hurts. If he hits me
again I’ll tell Sam. I’m not going to stand it.”</p>

<p>Jack found there was nothing special for him
to do until the street parade was ready to start.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
This had been omitted in the town they had just
left, as the place was not considered important
enough for such a demonstration. Here, however,
one was to be given, and Jack learned that all the
clowns were to ride on top of a big gilded wagon,
each one playing some grotesque musical instrument.</p>

<p>“But I can’t play anything but a mouth organ,”
the boy had objected to Sam, who told him what
was expected of him.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference. We only
make all the noise we can on battered horns, broken
drums and all the odd things the property man
can get together. I’ll give you a trumpet. All
you’ll have to do is to blow it as loud as you can.”</p>

<p>Jack thought this would be easy enough, and
he soon retired to the dressing-tent to make-up for
the street parade. The big wagon on which the
clowns were to ride was hauled by eight prancing
horses, and when Jack saw it, and knew he was
to be on it, he felt a sense of pride that he had so
soon been able to make a place for himself in such
a big aggregation as a circus.</p>

<p>“All clowns this way!” cried Sam Kyle as he
came from the dressing-tent. “Here are your instruments.”</p>

<p>The funnily-attired and painted men, including
our hero, gathered around their leader, who handed
out such a collection of noise-producing apparatus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
as was seldom seen. Each one had once
been a musical instrument, but time and accident,
in some cases purposely done, had changed the
character of them. Now they produced nothing
but discordant sounds.</p>

<p>“All ready!” called Sam. “Get up!”</p>

<p>The clowns began to ascend to the top of the
high wagon, which was fitted with cross-seats.</p>

<p>“Come! come! Hurry up!” cried Mr. Paine,
running up to the clowns’ wagon. “The parade
ought to have started an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“We’re all ready,” replied Sam.</p>

<p>“Step lively!” added another voice, and there
came a crack like a pistol shot. At the same time
Jack felt a stinging pain in his hip. He turned
in time to see Otto Mitz, the ringmaster, swinging
his vicious whip. The man did not have on his
dress-suit, but was ordinarily attired.</p>

<p>Jack started with the sudden pain, and Ted
Chester laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to wake him up,” he said.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do that again, Mitz!” exclaimed
Sam Kyle, for he had seen the mean act.</p>

<p>“I guess I will if I like. I’m practicing.”</p>

<p>“Then you try it on yourself,” added Sam angrily.</p>

<p>“I’ll try it on you if I feel like it,” went on the
ringmaster.</p>

<p>Sam, with a suddenness that took Mitz by surprise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
rushed up to him, grabbed the whip from
his hand and threw it to one side.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t advise you to,” he said quietly.
“Don’t you flick that lad again with your whip.”
And then he turned and began to ascend the
wagon.</p>

<p>There was an ominous silence about the clowns’
wagon, and more than one expected to see a fight
between the ringmaster and Sam. But Mitz, with
a deep flush on his face, walked over, picked up
his whip, and disappeared into the dressing-tent.</p>

<p>“He’ll have it in for you, Sam,” remarked a
jolly, fat little clown.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of him,” replied Sam. “He’s
too free with his whip, and it’s time some one told
him so. Did he hurt you much?” he asked of
Jack in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Not much,” replied the lad, though the truth
was the lash had bitten deep, and he had had hard
work to refrain from crying out. But he bravely
repressed his feelings.</p>

<p>Then the band on the wagon struck up, the
steam calliope began to play, and the parade started.
Soon the procession was in the midst of the
streets of a fair-sized city. Jack, doing as he saw
Sam and the other clown do, blew as loudly as
possible on his trumpet. The grotesque music
raised many a laugh, as did the funny antics of the
clowns.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>At times some of them stood up and made
elaborate bows, as if in answer to applause, while
others did little dance steps. But Jack sat silent,
save when he blew the trumpet. He was beginning
to see the darker side of the circus life.</p>

<p>“Be a little livelier,” whispered the clown next
to him. “There’s no telling when the old man is
watching.”</p>

<p>By the “old man” was meant Manager Paine,
though no disrespect was intended by this title.
Thus urged, Jack tried to be gay and to cut some
of his funny tricks, but it was with no light heart.
He realized now what it meant to have to amuse
a crowd when one felt the least like it.</p>

<p>He was glad when the parade was over and he
could go back to the circus grounds. Sam told him
he could take off his clown dress and wash up, as
it would be several hours until the afternoon performance.</p>

<p>“A good dinner will make you feel better,” said
the head clown to the boy, for he understood how
the lad felt, as he had heard Jack’s story and had
taken an unusual liking to him.</p>

<p>Our hero did feel better after the meal, and he
looked forward, with something akin to real pleasure,
to the performance in which he was to take
part. The big tent was up now, and was gay with
many-colored flags and banners. Jack strolled
around to the side shows, and was amused in getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
a near view of the freaks, for he was a privileged
character now.</p>

<p>“Well, boy, I’ll have that flying machine for
you sooner than I expected,” said a voice at his
elbow, and he turned to see Mr. Delafield, the
property man. “I was speaking to Mr. Paine
about it, and he thinks it a good idea. I’ll have it
for you the first of the week. We strike Stewartsville
then, and that’s quite a town. Suppose you
come over to my tent and we’ll take a look at what
I’ve got done. Maybe you can suggest something.”</p>

<p>This gave a new turn to Jack’s thoughts. He
found that the property man had carried out his
ideas exactly, for Jack had made a rough sketch
of what he wanted to introduce into his act.</p>

<p>The flying machine consisted of a big muslin
bag, shaped like a cigar, and held distended by
barrel hoops. This was to make it look as if filled
with gas. Above it was a big Japanese umbrella,
while below it was a sort of harness, holding a
seat, which Jack could sit astride of.</p>

<p>On either side were big, tough paper-covered
wings, working on hinges, and they could be operated
by his feet. The handle of the big umbrella
extended down through the distended muslin bag,
so that Jack could grasp it with both hands.</p>

<p>His plan was, after going through some funny
stunts, to pretend to pump up the bag with air.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Then he would carry the “flying machine” to the
top of a small, light platform, which had been
made for the purpose. After some further odd
mannerisms he would jump to the ground, a distance
of about thirty feet. The big umbrella he
calculated would allow him to land without injury,
and as he descended he would work the paper
wings with his feet, giving a fairly good imitation
of a person flying.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” asked Mr. Delafield.
“Of course, it will be all painted up in
bright colors before you use it.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine!” exclaimed Jack enthusiastically. “I
wish it was ready now.”</p>

<p>“There’s quite a lot of work on it yet,” said the
property man. “But I’ll have it for you the first
of the week. I hope you make a hit with it.”</p>

<p>“I will if I don’t come down too heavy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that umbrella will hold you all right.
You’ll come down as easy as a piece of paper. I’ll
make it good and strong.”</p>

<p>“Hello! hello! hello! What’s this? What terror-inspiring
bird of prey from the towering peaks
of the Andes Mountains is about to perform before
an awe-struck multitude for the first time in
the history of the world?” asked another voice,
and Jack and Mr. Delafield looked up to see the
fat, jolly countenance of Nolan Waddleton, the
“adjective man.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Oh, this is a new machine for a flying clown,”
explained the property man. “Jack is going to
spring something different.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I must have that for my posters,” said
Mr. Waddleton. “That will be quite a drawing
card. I need something fresh and new. Let’s see.
Nerve-thrilling trip through the terrestrial——No,
that won’t do. You’re going to keep off the
earth. Through the towering—no, I’ve used that
before. Oh, can’t you give me a couple of adjectives,
some of you?” and he looked appealingly at
Sam and Jack.</p>

<p>“How would ‘Startling sensation of a Simple
Simon sailing serenely, supereminently and satisfactorily
over the heads of a startled, strabismus-struck,
sensation-satiated assemblage in an admirably
adapted aeroplane’ strike you?” asked Mr.
Delafield.</p>

<p>“Excellent! superb! lovely! marvelous! That’ll
do first-rate!” exclaimed the “adjective man” enthusiastically.
“I must write that down. We’ll
have you on the bills soon,” he added, turning to
Jack.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>JACK MAKES A HIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> afternoon’s performance was well attended.
Jack did the same thing he had done on the
previous day and was moderately well applauded.
As usual, however, Sam Kyle created the most
laughter, for he had an act that was mirth-provoking,
and he took advantage of various happenings
in the ring to turn a joke or do some odd
stunt that was sure to bring forth clapping.</p>

<p>Ted Chester, with his miniature automobile,
made a hit also. The people seemed to like him,
and this delighted Ted. He strutted about as
“proud as a turkey just before Thanksgiving,” as
one of the other clowns put it.</p>

<p>“Mind you keep away from my side of the
ring,” cautioned Ted as he met Jack on the big
circular track. “If I find you interfering with me
again I’ll take matters into my own hands. I
don’t care for Sam Kyle. If you bother with me
and spoil my act, you’ve got to take the consequences.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“I’m not going to bother you,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s a hot act you have,” went on Ted. “I
wonder the old man lets you get away with it.
What in the world people can find in that to laugh
at I can’t see. It’s on the blink, I think.”</p>

<p>Jack did not consider that any good would come
of answering the mean clown, and he passed into
the dressing-tent, as his turn was over for the afternoon.
He encountered his friend Sam, who was
washing up after the performance.</p>

<p>“I saw Ted talking to you,” began the veteran
clown. “Is he bothering you?”</p>

<p>“No—not much,” replied Jack, determined to
fight his own battles as far as he could.</p>

<p>“If he does, let me know, and I’ll speak to the
old man about him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I can get along.”</p>

<p>“All right, only you know I’ll stand by you.
Say, I’ve got a suggestion for you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you make the paper-covered hoops
you now use more in the shape of wings? You
can easily do it, for the wood frame is light and
not hard to bend.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. I guess I will, until my
regular machine is ready. I’ll have that Monday
or Tuesday, Mr. Delafield said.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. And say, while you’re about it,
why don’t you color the wings? Get some paint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
and daub ’em up so’s they’ll show off better. And
you might get up a different sort of suit. I’ve got
lots of material.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be a good idea?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Change and variety is what we’ve got
to give the public. Besides, the old man likes to
see a change in the acts once in a while. Brighten
things up a bit, and I think he’ll appreciate it.”</p>

<p>“I will,” replied Jack, and that afternoon he
made some paper affairs that looked more like
wings than did the hoops, while he sewed some
bright-colored patches on his white suit and made
up to look like some grotesque bird.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” exclaimed Sam as he saw his protégé
getting ready for the ring that night.
“You’ve got the right knack, Jack. You’d ought
to have been in this business before.”</p>

<p>“I like it,” said the runaway lad. “It just suits
me, so far, though it hasn’t been all easy sailing.
But I sometimes think I’ve made a mistake. I
should have stayed with the professor, for that’s
where the first news of my folks will come, and
I’m getting worried about them. I’m afraid they
may have been killed by the fanatical Chinese.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe anything as bad as that has
happened,” replied Sam. “I read the papers every
day, and while there are dispatches telling of trouble
in China, no Americans have suffered.”</p>

<p>“But the trouble is we can’t seem to get any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
trace of my folks,” went on Jack. “The authorities
don’t know where they are, and how can they
tell whether anything has happened to them or
not?”</p>

<p>“Well, look on the bright side of things. That’s
my motto,” answered the clown. “That’s what
we’re for—to make people forget their troubles.
Take a little of your own medicine, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess that’s a good idea. I’ll try it.
Only I wish I could hear some news of my folks.
If I make any money this season I’ll go to China
and hunt for them.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll make some cash,” went on the
clown. “But that’s our cue to enter the ring.
Come on now, laugh and smile. A clown that
looks as if he had lost his best friend isn’t much
use in a circus. Be happy!</p>

<p>“Hoop la!” he went on, as he ran from the
dressing-tent into the ring. “Oo la la! Tra-la-la!
La-de-da!”</p>

<p>Then he turned a couple of handsprings, very
nimbly, in spite of his age, and went on with his
act, which, if roars of laughter indicated anything,
must have pleased the audience.</p>

<p>Jack ran out with some of the other clowns, carrying
a pair of his new paper wings. Other pairs,
for he had made several that afternoon, were at
different parts of the ring, ready for him, as he
broke a pair each time he did his act.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>There was an unusually large crowd present and
every performer, feeling the stimulation of it, was
doing his best. It seemed to Jack that he could do
funnier capers than he had ever before attempted,
and soon he had a goodly section of the assemblage
laughing at his tricks with the imitation
wings.</p>

<p>“Most merrily mirth-making,” said Mr. Waddleton,
the “adjective man,” as he passed near
Jack. “I’m watching you. I’m going to have
your new act on the bills.”</p>

<p>This encouraged the boy, and he went on with
a vim, doing his odd dance, his big wings flapping
out behind him.</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum! Not so bad. Not half bad!”
remarked Mr. Paine, the manager, who, in accordance
with his custom, was passing about the
ring observing matters. “You’re doing very well,
Jack.”</p>

<p>This made Jack forget, in a measure, his
troubles—those caused by his life at the professor’s
house, and his flight from it, as well as those
for which his enemies in the circus were responsible.</p>

<p>Jack felt a sense of happiness as he crawled
into his bunk in the sleeping-car that night, and he
was becoming so used to the strange life that he
did not lie awake very long. Before he knew it,
morning came, and the show was at the next stop.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>This was on Saturday, and, after a good day’s
business in a large country town, the circus started
for Stewartsville, where it was to remain two
days; Sunday, during which no performance would
be given, and Monday, when the usual afternoon
and evening exhibitions would take place.</p>

<p>Sunday was pretty much a day of rest with the
circus folk. Of course the tents had to be put up
in the morning, and the animals arranged in
places. And the beasts had to be fed, and the performers,
whose talents depended on their muscles
or dexterity, did not forego their daily practice, to
keep in condition. But, for the majority of the
circus crowd, there was little to do.</p>

<p>Jack took advantage of the opportunity to go
and look at the animals, for which he had very
little time during the regular circus day. He was
fond of wild beasts, and he made the acquaintance
of some of the keepers. He was also introduced
to the fat lady and the skeleton man, who were
among the freaks in the side show. He found
them both nice persons, and, in their turn, they
seemed attracted to the boy, who, in spite of his
unusually good luck in getting along so well as a
newcomer, in the circus, was quite lonesome at
times.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the afternoon Mr. Delafield
called Jack into the property tent. The sight
of a big object in the middle caused Jack to utter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
an exclamation. There was his new flying machine,
complete.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” he cried. “It will be ready for
to-morrow, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think so. The paint isn’t quite dry, but it
will be by morning.”</p>

<p>The affair was gaudily colored, to match the
suit which Jack had decided to wear. He could
hardly wait for morning to try it, and, as soon as
he had his breakfast, he took it into the main tent,
where, with the help of the property man and
Sam Kyle, he had his first rehearsal.</p>

<p>It worked fairly well, though it was found
necessary to make one or two readjustments. But
these were finished by afternoon, and Jack got
ready for his first appearance in his new rôle, that
of an eccentric, clownish airship inventor.</p>

<p>He was a little nervous as he took his apparatus
with him out into the ring that afternoon, and set
it down in a space in front of the reserved seats.
Then, with an affair that looked like an air pump,
he pretended to fill the muslin bag. All the while
he assumed the part of a man who has just completed
an aeroplane and is anxious to see how it
will work.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! See the airship! See the airship!”
cried a boy in the audience close to Jack.
“Will he really fly, mamma?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“I don’t know, Bertie. Watch and see,” replied
the lady.</p>

<p>“I’m going to fly a little way, if I have luck,”
said Jack to himself.</p>

<p>The attention of a considerable portion of the
crowd was now drawn to him. With a heart that
beat faster than usual, he went on with his grotesque
preparations. Then he hauled the machine,
which was very light, up on the platform.</p>

<p>There was a laugh as he spread out the big
umbrella. Then, pretending to peer up to the sky,
as if in search of storm clouds, Jack took his place
on the suspended seat. The affair was so arranged
that he could walk in it to the edge of the platform
before he leaped off.</p>

<p>He recited a funny little verse, composed for
him by Mr. Waddleton, containing references to
the various airship inventors then in the public
eye, stood poised for a moment on the edge of the
platform, and then, hoping that everything was all
right, and that he would land safely, he leaped off.</p>

<p>Down, down, down he sailed, the big umbrella
buoying him up like a parachute. He kicked vigorously
with his feet, and the big wings flapped up
and down. The crowd burst into loud laughter
and there was hearty applause.</p>

<p>Lower and lower Jack sank down, falling
gently to the ground. He ceased to work the
wings, and then came the climax. He pulled a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
string and there was a report like a small cannon,
while the bag which was held apart with hoops
and springs, collapsed, and the umbrella closed up
with a snap. It looked exactly as if the imitation
airship had blown up on reaching the ground, but
this was only a trick Mr. Delafield had devised at
the last moment.</p>

<p>My, what laughter and applause there was
then! It was one of the oddest sights seen in the
circus. Jack knew there was no doubt about it—he
had made a hit.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>PROFESSOR KLOPPER APPEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">That’s</span> the stuff!” cried Mr. Paine, running up
to where Jack was getting out of the collapsed airship.
This was the first the boy knew that the
manager had been watching him. But there was
very little that escaped the “old man.” “You’re
doing good,” the manager went on. “Quick, now,
on the other side. The people there are wondering
what it’s all about. Here,” he cried to several
men, “help get this platform over by the box and
press seats. This is a good stunt!”</p>

<p>Jack was proud and happy. Of course he had
higher ambitions than being a circus clown, but
while he was in that rôle he was going to do his
best. Besides, he wanted to earn all the money
he could, so that he might go and search for his
father and mother, and he hoped that if he did
well his salary might be increased.</p>

<p>“Do the same thing over here,” said Mr. Paine.
“Make it as funny as you can. It’s a hit, all right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Ha! Hum! It’s not so bad! It’s not so bad!”
which was praise indeed from Mr. Paine.</p>

<p>Jack repeated his act, and was applauded louder
than ever. Then he had to go to the far end of
the tent, where the ordinary seats were. There
he was well received, the final collapse of the aeroplane
apparently affording the best amusement of
all.</p>

<p>“Down at the other end now,” ordered the
manager, who seemed to be keeping an eye on
Jack. Though the boy did not know it, managers
of shows, whether they be circuses or theatrical
performances, are always on the lookout for novelties,
and they are only too willing to advance
young players who show that they can stand out
above the average, and gain the plaudits of the
crowd, which is all, save the ticket receipts, that a
manager usually cares about.</p>

<p>Just as Jack was getting up on his platform for
his last airship performance, Ted Chester, who
was creating some amusement by his antics with
the miniature automobile, came along.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to do your act here!” he exclaimed
to Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” replied our hero boldly.</p>

<p>“I say you’re not! I’m going to show here, and
I’m not going to have you butting in. Clear out of
here!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Paine sent me here.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“I don’t care whether he did or not. I say I’m
going to do my turn here, and you can’t. You’re
always around bothering me, and I won’t stand
for it!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do my act here,” declared Jack.
“I was told to by the manager.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether you were or not.”</p>

<p>“Besides, the platform is erected here now,”
went on the young clown, “and the men have gone.
I can’t move it.”</p>

<p>“Then cut your act out. You’re not going to
spoil mine.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Make him quit,” advised Mitz,
the ringmaster, who had just finished putting several
horses through their paces, and who was retiring
to the dressing-tent. “Make him quit the
show,” he added.</p>

<p>Jack looked at him apprehensively, but the
ugly ringmaster had been taught a lesson. He did
not flick his whip at the boy.</p>

<p>The young clown hesitated. He did not know
whether to ignore Ted and go on with his act, or
appeal to Mr. Paine, who was at the far side of
the ring, making an announcement about a young
woman who did a “loop the gap” act in an automobile.</p>

<p>But there was an unexpected diversion in Jack’s
favor. Sam Kyle, in his progress around the big
ring, had seen that something was amiss. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
his duty to settle disputes among the clowns, and
he often had to do so, as, since these performers
had no regular place for their acts, one frequently
would appear in the same spot where a fellow-actor
was showing off.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Sam, as he approached.</p>

<p>“He’s butting in on me,” replied Ted, in surly
tones.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is,” added the ringmaster.</p>

<p>“This is none of your affair,” declared Sam to
the man in the dress-suit. “I think I can settle it.
Go on with your act, Jack,” he said.</p>

<p>“And spoil mine?” demanded Ted.</p>

<p>“You’ve already been on four times this afternoon,”
said the head clown. “I’ve been keeping
watch of you. This will make your fifth act.
Four’s all you’re allowed unless I say so, and I
don’t. Go on, Jack.”</p>

<p>“But I——” began Ted.</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” advised Sam. “I haven’t time to
listen to you, but let me tell you one thing, if you
interfere again with Jack, and make trouble, I’ll
have you fired, that’s what I’ll do! And you know
I’m a man of my word, and that I can do as I say,”
he added significantly. “Take your auto and get
out of the ring. Jack has a good act, and he’s entitled
to the credit of it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“I’ll—I’ll——” spluttered Ted, who was very
angry.</p>

<p>“Don’t you threaten me!” exclaimed Sam.
“I’ve told you what to do, and I want you to
do it!”</p>

<p>Ted had no choice but to obey, though he did
it with no very good grace. Jack prepared for
his act, while the ringmaster, who had been too
busy before to notice, looked on sneeringly. He
was a great chum of Ted, and for this reason,
more than because he had any reason to dislike
Jack, he had a grudge against our hero.</p>

<p>The airship act went off well, the applause at
the last attempt being louder than any that had
preceded it. Jack felt very proud.</p>

<p>He repeated his success that evening, and he
was more than gratified when Mr. Paine, seeking
him out at the close of the show, announced that
his wages would be raised to fifteen dollars a week.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon get to China at that rate,” thought
Jack, for, since he had to spend nothing for board,
he could save nearly all his salary.</p>

<p>With practice, Jack became more proficient in
odd little parts, until in about two weeks he was
one of the best attractions of the ring. His act
was mentioned on the bills, though he was given
no name, for he had not yet arisen to be a star of
that magnitude.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the circus was traveling about from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
city to city, and Jack was becoming accustomed
to the free and easy life, though it had its drawbacks,
especially in a storm.</p>

<p>“Where do we show to-morrow?” asked the
boy of Sam, one night when they were in the sleeping
car.</p>

<p>“Northrup is the next stop.”</p>

<p>“Northrup? That’s not far from where I live—or
used to live,” he added, as he thought rather
sadly that he had no real home now. “Maybe I’ll
see some of the boys from Westville,” he went on.</p>

<p>Jack was strolling about the next morning, after
a good breakfast, watching the men put up the big
tent, an operation of which he never tired. There
was the usual crowd of boys looking on, and our
hero glanced among them for the possible sight
of some one he might know. Often, when he was
younger, he had gone from Westville to Northrup
to see the circus come in. But he saw no familiar
faces, and was turning to go back to the dressing-tent,
for it was nearly time to get ready for the
street parade, when he was startled by hearing
a voice ask of one of the canvasmen:</p>

<p>“Is this Bower &amp; Brewster’s circus?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” replied the man shortly.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my man. I am looking for a certain
person, and I heard he was with this show.”</p>

<p>Jack’s heart almost stopped beating. He knew
that voice only too well. It was that of Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Klopper. And a guarded look at the man who
had asked the question showed the boy that he was
right.</p>

<p>Hidden behind a tent-pole wagon, Jack peered
cautiously out, and beheld the figure of his former
guardian, stern and forbidding, looking about
him.</p>

<p>“He’s after me,” thought Jack. “What shall
I do? I’ll never let him arrest me. I must hide!
No, I know a better plan than that,” he added to
himself. “I’ll make up in my clown outfit. He’ll
never know me then, even if he does see me. But
I’ll take precious good care to keep out of his
sight.”</p>

<small>JACK’S TRICK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hurrying</span> to the dressing-tent, but taking good
care not to get within sight of the professor, Jack
quickly donned his clown suit.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked several of the other performers,
who were lounging about, or going over
their trunks. “It isn’t time for the parade, is it?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied Jack. “I just thought
I’d get ready, though,” for, though a number of
the circus people knew something of his story, he
did not think it wise to tell why he was going to
dress up so early. “Ted Chester or the ringmaster
would give me up to him as quick as a wink,”
thought our hero, “and I’m not going to submit to
arrest now.”</p>

<p>He went on with his make-up, and was daubing
the red and white paint on his face when Sam Kyle
came into the tent.</p>

<p>“Making up early, aren’t you?” asked Sam,
looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“A little,” admitted Jack. “But I wanted to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
ready in time. Then I guess I’ll practice some new
stunts with my flying machine.”</p>

<p>“Humph! You can practice a good deal better
in your regular clothes than you can in that suit,”
remarked Sam.</p>

<p>But Jack gave no reason for his peculiar action.
When he was all rigged out, ready to take his place
on the wagon, or enter the ring, he ventured out of
the tent.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the professor would know me if he
saw me now,” he thought. “Guess I’ll walk about
and see if I can catch sight of him. I’ll have to
be cautious, though.”</p>

<p>He strolled about the circus grounds, attracting
considerable attention from a number of small
boys, for there were no other performers in sight
so early in the morning. Jack walked about, keeping
watch for the professor, and when he did not
observe him he began to breathe easier. He was
glad when the time came to get up on the wagon,
and take his place among the clowns who played
the odd musical instruments.</p>

<p>Just as the procession started from the circus
grounds to parade through the streets, he caught
sight of his guardian, hurrying along, and peering
about anxiously through his big spectacles.</p>

<p>“He’s looking for me,” decided Jack. “Queer
how he should be so vindictive. He must know I
wouldn’t steal his old cup. I wish he’d go back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
home. It’s no fun to fear every minute that you’re
going to be arrested.”</p>

<p>To better screen himself from the professor’s
gaze, in case the elderly man should inspect the
clown wagon too closely, our hero placed his trumpet
to his lips, and began to blow. This was a
signal for the other oddly attired performers to begin,
and soon the wagon passed beyond where Mr.
Klopper was standing.</p>

<p>“I’m safe for a while, anyhow,” mused Jack.
“It was a good thing I thought of this trick.”</p>

<p>When the procession returned to the grounds
most of the performers began to remove their suits,
and the clowns washed the paint from their faces,
as it would be some time before the afternoon performance
would start.</p>

<p>Jack, however, remained in his clown suit, with
the coloring matter still thick on his face.</p>

<p>“Going to stay that way until you get your cue?”
asked a fellow clown.</p>

<p>“I—I guess so,” replied Jack. “Might as well.
It won’t be long.”</p>

<p>“Too long for me,” was the reply. “I get
enough of it as it is. No paint for mine until the
last minute, and off it comes as soon as I’m
through.”</p>

<p>But Jack had a good reason for keeping his on.
His own mother would not have known him in his
present costume. To avoid the many questions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the other performers, who could not understand the
boy’s action, Jack, after a hasty dinner, went into
the main tent, which was now up, and pretended
to be adjusting his imitation airship. He remained
there until almost time for the afternoon show to
start, and then he started back to the dressing-tent
to await the blast of the trumpets that summoned
the company of clowns.</p>

<p>As he was coming out of the main tent he almost
ran into a man who was standing on the outside,
near the dressing-rooms. Jack started back in surprise,
for, as the man turned, he saw that he was
none other than Professor Klopper.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” exclaimed the former college
teacher, “but I am looking for a friend of
mine—a young lad—who, I understand, is with
this circus. He ran away to join it, and I wish to
find him about a very particular matter. Can you
tell me where he is? His name is Jack Allen.”</p>

<p>Jack almost stopped breathing. He could
scarcely believe that the professor would not recognize
him.</p>

<p>Not daring to trust his voice to make reply, and
fearing the professor would know his tones, if he
did not know his ward’s face under the coating of
paint, Jack shook his head to answer in the negative,
and hurried on.</p>

<p>“One moment,” exclaimed the professor. “Perhaps
you——”</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p148.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“I am looking for a friend of mine”<br />

<span class="illoright"><i>Page <a href="#Page_148">148</a></i></span></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>But Jack, still vigorously shaking his head,
passed into the tent. He knew the professor, nor
any other outsider, would not be allowed to enter
there.</p>

<p>“My, that was a close call!” exclaimed the youth
to himself, as he applied a little more paint where
it had been rubbed off as he brushed against a tent
flap. “I’ll put it on good and thick,” he decided.
“I can’t take any chances. He’ll be in the audience
watching for me, sure.”</p>

<p>He used more paint than he ever had before,
and succeeded in securing a very comical effect,
which added to his queer appearance.</p>

<p>His nervousness and fear did not prevent him
from giving a good performance, and, as he went
to the different parts of the ring, doing his turn
with the airship, he looked anxiously among the
throng to see if he could observe the professor.
But it was impossible to pick out any particular individual
in that big audience, and Jack felt safe,
at least for the time being.</p>

<p>After the performance, instead of removing his
costume and washing off the paint, he remained attired
as he was in his clown outfit. His friends
tried to find out why he kept it on all day, but he
did not tell them.</p>

<p>“He’s getting crazy, that’s what’s the matter
with him,” said Ted Chester, with a sneer. “He’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
so stuck on his act that he thinks all the people are
looking at him.”</p>

<p>“That’s usually the way you are,” commented
Sam Kyle. “You can’t throw any stones, Ted.”</p>

<p>“Aw, who’s talking to you?” demanded Ted, in
surly tones.</p>

<p>But in spite of the many questions asked him, as
to his reason, Jack kept his suit on. Nor did he go
out of the dressing-tent any more than he had to,
for he thought the professor might be strolling
about looking for him.</p>

<p>Whether or not his former guardian was on the
lookout that afternoon and evening, Jack did not
then find out. His one fear was lest the professor
should go to the manager of the circus and make
inquiries, for, in that event, the runaway boy would
have been discovered. But Mr. Klopper evidently
did not think of that, and when the show was over
that night, and Jack found he had not been detected,
he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Well, I should think you’d be glad to get those
togs off,” remarked Sam, when Jack resumed his
regular clothes, and started for the train.</p>

<p>“I am,” was the answer, but Jack said nothing
more, and Sam wondered what was coming over
his protégé.</p>

<p>But if Jack had only known what the professor
had to tell him, how willingly would the boy have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
revealed himself! Mr. Klopper had come to the
circus, not only to find our hero, but also to impart
some valuable information. But now the news was
lost to the boy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>A TREACHEROUS ACT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> several weeks after this the circus traveled
about from city to city, sometimes taking in large
towns, and gradually working through the middle
west, spending considerable time in Ohio and Indiana.
Jack was beginning to like the life more
and more, in spite of the hard work, for, though
there was plenty of fun connected with it, there was
also no lack of hardships.</p>

<p>He continued to improve in his act and had received
another raise of salary, now getting eighteen
dollars a week, which was as much as some of the
other clowns earned.</p>

<p>Jack was careful with his money, and, at Sam’s
suggestion, left most of it with the treasurer of the
show. For there were many temptations to spend
money when on the road, and Jack had more than
once declined to gamble or spend his cash for
drinks or cigars.</p>

<p>“I never saw such a tight-wad as you are,” said
Ted Chester one day, when he had invited Jack to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
enter a card game with him. “Why don’t you
loosen up a bit?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to waste my money gambling,” replied
Jack. “I’ve got a better use for it. Why
don’t you play with some of the other fellows?”</p>

<p>“Because they’re sports, and they’ve spent all
their money until next salary day.”</p>

<p>The truth was, though, that few of the circus
folk liked to play with Ted, who had a reputation
of cheating when he got the chance. He and Mitz
were generally together, seeking to get some one
interested in a card game, and it was whispered
that they acted as partners in fleecing the unwary
ones who played with them.</p>

<p>But Jack had been warned by his friend, Sam
Kyle, to have nothing to do with any card games,
and not to drink or smoke. He would probably
not have done so anyhow, as the boy had the advantage
of excellent home training; but temptation
is sometimes very strong, and Sam did not want to
see his protégé get into bad habits.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing in this sporting life—drinking,
smoking, and gambling,” said Sam. “I’ve
done my share of it, and I know what I’m talking
about. It’s fun for a while, but you have to pay
a dear price for it.</p>

<p>“I used to squander my money that way, but an
old man gave me some good advice in time, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
quit. Now I’m saving up for the time when I get
too old to amuse folks any longer.”</p>

<p>“And I’m saving up to try and find my folks,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you had any word from them?”</p>

<p>“Not a word since I ran away. I don’t suppose
I could have received any, traveling about as we
do. Sometimes I wish I had stayed with the professor.
He was real mean to me, and would have
had me arrested. But even then I might have
heard some word from my father or mother.
Now I’m not likely to unless I can get to China, or
unless I go back to the professor.”</p>

<p>“I’d advise you to do the last,” said Sam. “It’s
a long way to China, and I doubt if you could do
much, or find out much, after you got there. Go
back to the professor.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll have me arrested. I don’t want to be
locked up for something I didn’t do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you for that. But wait a while.
There’s no need to go back right away. Finish out
the season with us, if you like. I know the old man
would hate to lose you now.”</p>

<p>“I want to stay, too,” said Jack. “I’m getting
to like the life very much.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, stick it out till fall. Then write to
the professor, asking for news of your folks.
He’ll give you some, if he has it, even though he
wants to arrest you. But perhaps by then he’ll get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
over his anger, or maybe he’ll find, in the meanwhile,
that you didn’t steal the cup. Anyway, you
can write to him, and promise to return, if he will
not have you locked up, until you have a chance
to prove that you’re innocent. That’s what I’d
do.”</p>

<p>“I guess I will,” decided Jack. “I’ll write to
him when it’s about time for the circus to close
up.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be for a couple of months yet,”
said Sam. “Maybe you’d better write now.”</p>

<p>“No, if I do, very likely he’d find out where I
was and have me locked up. I’ll wait a while.”</p>

<p>But if Jack had only written then he would have
saved himself much anguish of heart, and not a
little physical suffering. But he did not know, not
being able to look into the future.</p>

<p>One day, after he had finished his performance
in the ring, Jack went to the property man.</p>

<p>“I wish I could have my platform made a little
higher,” he said.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t much chance for the air to get
under the umbrella when I jump off now. If I
made a higher leap I could work the wings a little
better, for I’d be in the air longer. Can you raise
the platform?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. How much?”</p>

<p>“About ten feet.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“But that will make it nearly forty feet for you
to jump. Won’t that be rather dangerous?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. You see, the umbrella is a big
one, and once it gets a lot of air under it, I’m held
up, and I’ll come down slowly. Besides, it will
make a better act. I can make it look more as if I
was really flying.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll do it. Did you ask Mr. Paine?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and he said it would be all right. He
likes the idea.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Waddleton will have to get some new adjectives
to put on the bills about you,” remarked
the property man, with a laugh. “He thinks
you’re quite an attraction. You’ve got Ted and
some of the other clowns jealous. They’re at me
all the while to get them up something so they can
make a hit.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s nothing to stop them,” declared
Jack. “I don’t care how many queer stunts they
do.”</p>

<p>“Me either; only I’m not going to think ’em out
for ’em and then make ’em. I told ’em I’d make
’em if they’d tell me what they wanted, but they
haven’t got brains enough to do that. They make
me tired!” and the property man went on with his
work of patching up a big sea serpent that one of
the clowns used in an act. “I’ll make that platform
higher for you to-morrow,” he said to Jack;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
“only you want to be careful how you jump off
from such a height.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the young clown, and then he went
into the tent to rest until the evening performance,
for he was rather tired, as he had responded to several
encores that afternoon.</p>

<p>The platform, made ten feet higher, was ready
for him the next day, when they opened in a good-sized
city in Indiana. He got his flying machine in
readiness, and it was carted out by a couple of the
ring hands, for since Jack had made such a success
he was given more attention by the manager, who
detailed two men to help the lad, since the apparatus
was now quite bulky to move about, though it
was very light. Jack had made one or two changes
in it, and had rigged up some United States flags
on the top of the umbrella, the emblems being suddenly
displayed by the pulling of a string as he began
to sail downward.</p>

<p>“Now, Jack,” said Sam Kyle, as the clowns ran
out of the dressing-tent, in response to the trumpet
signal, “let’s see how your improvement works. I
expect you’ll sail all about the tent now.”</p>

<p>“Hardly; but I can give a better exhibition, I
think.”</p>

<p>He climbed up to the top of the slender platform.
Then, after his usual song and dance, he
prepared to take his place on the seat of the flying
machine. First, however, as was his custom, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
carefully examined the umbrella, for it was on this
he relied to save him from the effects of his high
jump, the big Japanese affair acting as does a parachute
when a man leaps from a balloon.</p>

<p>Something about some of the ribs attracted the
boy’s attention. He looked more carefully. To
his horror, he saw that nearly all of them had been
cut through so that when he jumped the umbrella
would collapse, and let him fall to the ground with
such a suddenness that he would be seriously hurt,
if not killed. For a moment the terror of his discovery
of the treacherous act deprived him of the
ability to move or speak.</p>

<p>“Some one did this so I’d get hurt,” he whispered.
“I wonder who it could have been?”</p>

<p>Yet he at once thought of Ted Chester and his
crony, the ringmaster.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” thought Jack. “I can’t go
on with the act with this umbrella.”</p>

<p>He stood on the platform, undecided what to
do. The crowds, which had heard of his act, were
impatiently calling for him to leap.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Mr. Paine, running
to the foot of the platform. He had seen
from the other side of the ring that something was
wrong.</p>

<p>“My umbrella ribs have been cut,” replied Jack.
“I can’t jump with it this way.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed the manager. “That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
a mean trick! I’ll look into this. But wait.
Haven’t you a spare umbrella somewhere?”</p>

<p>“Yes, several of them.”</p>

<p>“All right. Come down. I’ll send for Delafield
to help you rig up another one. In the meantime
I’ll send Sam Kyle over here to jolly the
crowd along until you’re ready. He’ll say you
have to fix up your airship, because one built by the
German government tried to destroy it last night.
And say nothing about the umbrella until you hear
from me. Quick, now, get down.”</p>

<p>Thus did the quick-witted manager save the situation.
Jack descended, and soon, with Mr. Delafield’s
aid, he was attaching another umbrella to
the airship. Several had been supplied, in case one
might be damaged, and so little time was lost,
though the two flags could not be attached.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sam Kyle mounted to the platform,
and was keeping the crowd in roars of laughter by
his antics. As soon as Jack was ready he came
down, and our hero took his accustomed place.</p>

<p>Once more he carefully examined the umbrella
before venturing on his flight. This caution had
been impressed on him by Sam, and some of his
other friends. None of the performers who had
to do their acts high in the air, they said, would go
on a trapeze, bar or rope without first testing it.
For, not only were accidents likely to occur, but
often vindictive rivals would cut a rope partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
through, with the hope of maiming their more successful
fellows.</p>

<p>But this new umbrella was strong, and Jack
made ready for his leap. It was with more fear
than he had known since he had perfected his act
that he got astride the swaying seat, and, holding
to the umbrella handle, launched himself from the
platform, his feet working the big wings as fast as
they would flap.</p>

<p>To his delight, his new plan worked to perfection.
The air, having more of a chance to get
under the umbrella, buoyed him up considerably
better, and he sailed gracefully to the ground, the
flight taking several seconds longer. The chief
drawback to it formerly had been that it was over
too quick. Now this objection had been removed.</p>

<p>Then Jack pulled the cord which fired the shot,
and the ship seemed to fly apart, the umbrella closing
down and the bag collapsing. There was
hearty applause for the young clown, but through
it all Jack was wondering at the motive of those
who had so nearly caused a serious accident.</p>

<small>THE MONKEYS ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the afternoon performance came to an
end, Mr. Paine sent for Jack. He closely questioned
the boy about the cut umbrella. Jack could
throw no light on when it had been done.</p>

<p>“Whom do you suspect did it?” asked the manager.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, you do. You have some idea. Who’s
got a grudge against you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose Ted Chester has, though I
never did anything to him.”</p>

<p>“Who else?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Mitz was rather mean to me.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum! I begin to understand something.
You may tell Mr. Delafield I want him.”</p>

<p>Jack summoned the property man, and the manager
closely questioned him as to whether he had
seen any one about the airship just before the performance
began, for it had been proved that the
apparatus was in perfect order that morning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“I didn’t see any one interfering with it,” replied
Mr. Delafield.</p>

<p>“Were you in the property tent all the while?”</p>

<p>“Yes—that is, nearly.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mitz called me out to see about making
a new tub for the baby elephant to stand on.”</p>

<p>“How long were you gone?”</p>

<p>“About ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum! That would be time enough. I
think I see how this was done. Mitz and Chester
put up the game, and a mean one it was. While
Mitz got you out, Chester slipped in and cut the
umbrella. Say nothing about it, however. I’ll
have a talk with them. I’ll put a stop to this business.”</p>

<p>What the result was of the manager’s talk to
the mean clown and his crony, the ringmaster, Jack
never heard. Evidently there was not proof
enough to make certain the guilt of either of the
two men, though when they came from the manager’s
tent they looked worried and uneasy.</p>

<p>The affair resulted in one thing that benefited
Jack, however, for, after that, neither the clown
nor Mitz bothered him, though Ted Chester said
mean things to his young rival every chance he got.</p>

<p>After that Jack was more than usually careful
to look to all the ropes and other strengthening devices
on the airship, as well as to the umbrella; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
leaping off from such a height as he did it would
not take much to cause him to take a terrible
tumble.</p>

<p>The circus played a number of one-day stands
through the lower part of Ohio, and then swinging
around in a big circle, began to work back east.
As the larger cities were reached they stayed longer
in one place, in some remaining a week, which gave
the performers and animals a chance to get a good
rest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jack had heard nothing more from
the professor, nor about the efforts to cause an arrest
for the theft of the gold cup. The young
clown kept a wary eye out for the sight of a policeman
who might be looking for him, and he was
also on his guard against meeting Mr. Klopper.</p>

<p>But he need not have worried. The professor,
after his one attempt to locate Jack, gave it up personally,
though he tried other means to find the
boy, for, as before stated, he had something very
important to tell our hero.</p>

<p>The circus reached a town in western Pennsylvania
one morning during quite a heavy storm. It
had been raining off and on for a week, and the
temper of all the employees and performers was
tried by the unpleasant weather. A circus is quite
a miserable place in the rain, for the usual crowds
do not turn out, and everything seems to go wrong.</p>

<p>“I hope it clears up by this afternoon,” said Sam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Kyle gloomily, as he left the breakfast tent, which
leaked in places, and, with Jack, and some of the
other clowns, looked up at the dull sky. “I’m sick
of being wet through.”</p>

<p>The show had to go on, rain or shine, however,
and the parade usually took place no matter how
hard it stormed. This was very unpleasant
for the performers, especially the clowns,
as the paint would persist in running off their faces,
giving them a streaked and bedraggled appearance,
which, while it added to their funny aspect, was
not just what they wanted.</p>

<p>“It looks as if it might clear,” said Jack hopefully.
“The wind seems to be shifting.”</p>

<p>But it was raining when the parade started, and
Jack and his fellow clowns were wet and cold
riding on top of the open wagon, playing their battered
instruments.</p>

<p>Now, whether the rain was the cause for what
happened when the procession reached the middle
of the town, where quite a crowd had gathered to
view it, or whether the little beasts managed to
break open the door, was not disclosed. At any
rate, just as the parade was turning back to the
grounds, the cage containing the monkeys suddenly
opened.</p>

<p>Jack was the first to notice it, for the clowns’
wagon was right behind that containing the long-tailed
creatures. He saw several of the monkeys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
leaping out of the opened door, and swinging
themselves up on top.</p>

<p>“The monkeys! The monkeys!” he cried.
“They’re getting loose!”</p>

<p>“They’re already loose,” observed Sam grimly.
“Now there’ll be some fun. They’re the hardest
of all animals to catch, once they get out.”</p>

<p>Shouts and laughter from the crowd, which, now
that there was more than the usual excitement, did
not seem to mind the rain, told the man driving
the monkey wagon that something was wrong. But
he hardly needed this warning, for, a moment
later, one of the mischievous simians snatched off
the driver’s hat, and clapped it on its own queer
head. Another monkey grabbed it from the first
one, and soon the whole troop was on top of the
wagon fighting and chattering over the possession
of the hat.</p>

<p>The driver wound the reins about his whip, and
scrambled up on top of the vehicle in a desperate
endeavor to capture some of the nimble animals.
But, no sooner did they see him coming than, with
one accord, they scrambled down the sides of the
wagon, reached the ground, and, rejoicing in their
new-found freedom, scattered about the street.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys!” cried Sam. “Those monkeys
are valuable. We’ll have to help catch ’em.”</p>

<p>“Let the animal men look after ’em,” said Ted
Chester.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“The boss will appreciate it if we help,” remarked
the head clown. “Come on, boys.”</p>

<p>Jack and the other clowns dropping their battered
instruments, climbed down from the high
wagon, which had come to a stop, and began running
after the monkeys. But the mischievous
beasts had scattered among the crowd now.</p>

<p>Yells of laughter from the men lining the roadway,
mingling with the frightened screams of women
and children, told that the monkeys were creating
plenty of excitement.</p>

<p>“Grab ’em, folks! Grab ’em!” cried Sam to the
crowd.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see myself,” objected a fat woman.
“One of the ugly beasts tore my best bonnet to
pieces. I’m going to sue the circus!”</p>

<p>Just then a shout caused Jack to look where several
men were pointing. He saw a monkey
perched up on top of a store awning, tearing to
pieces something that looked like a bouquet of
many-colored flowers.</p>

<p>“My bonnet! Oh, my bonnet!” yelled the fat
woman. “There’s the ugly beast, now, tearing my
bonnet to pieces, and it cost three dollars!”</p>

<p>Yells from other women in the crowd indicated
that they, too, feared the same thing that had happened
to the fat lady. Nor were they far wrong.
The monkeys seemed to be attracted by the gay
headwear of the women in the crowd, and soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
there was presented the odd sight of half a dozen
of the creatures, perched up on high vantage
points, tearing to pieces the flowered and ribboned
hats, and scattering the pieces to the ground.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” suddenly cried a man. “One
of ’em’s trying to choke me!”</p>

<p>Jack ran to where he heard the cry. Perched
upon a man’s back was a monkey—a small one.</p>

<p>“Take him away! Take him away!” yelled the
man. “He’s choking me to death!”</p>

<p>The simian had one arm around the man’s neck,
but it was not trying to choke him. Instead, the
odd little creature was trying to reach a bright-red
balloon, one of the small kind sold when the circus
comes to town. The man had bought it for his
little girl.</p>

<p>“Give him the balloon!” cried the crowd, delighted
at the antics of the monkeys.</p>

<p>“No, no, daddy! It’s mine! Get the monkey
for me, too,” cried the little girl.</p>

<p>“Stand still a minute!” called Jack. “I’ll catch
the monkey.”</p>

<p>He hurried up to the man, and grabbed the hairy
little brute. The monkey tried to get away, but
Jack held it tight, and soon had carried it back to
the cage, having caught the first one of the runaways.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it,” said the man in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
charge of the monkey wagon. “The old man will
have a fit if we lose any.”</p>

<p>Jack ran back to try and capture some more. It
was an odd sight to see the queerly-dressed clowns,
with the paint on their faces running into all sorts
of streaks, darting through the crowd after the
monkeys. The excitement among the women continued,
and several bonnets had been ruined.</p>

<p>Some of the men in the throng now turned in
to help, and five or six of the long-tailed beasts
were caught. Jack captured another, and some of
the other clowns managed to grab the nimble creatures
as they scampered about.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes half of the number in the
cage had been caught. The others—the large
ones—had climbed to high points of the buildings
along the street, where they chattered away, as if
defying the men to get them.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring ’em back,” said the man who had
charge of them. He went into a store, and purchased
some apples, peanuts and candy. These
things he gave to the recaptured monkeys in the
cage, and the cries they set up as they fought over
the possession of the dainties, attracted the others,
who, anxious not to miss the feast, came trooping
along, only too glad to submit to being captured,
if only they could get something to eat.</p>

<p>“Whew! That was a strenuous time,” panted
Jack, as he took his place again on the wagon with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
his fellow clowns. “That was as good as part of
the circus.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the crowd got its money’s worth,” replied
Sam. “I suppose the old man will have to pay
damages for those hats, however.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>IN A STORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> more the parade started, and it completed
the circuit without further accident. To the delight
of every one, the rain ceased, and the sun came out
to dry off dripping tents, and drive away the
moisture from the soaked ground.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a fine crowd out this afternoon and
to-night, I think,” said Sam. “This is always a
good town to show in.”</p>

<p>Events proved that he was right, and when it
came time for the afternoon performance the big
tent was taxed to its capacity to hold the throng
gathered. All the performers seemed to have new
vim and vigor with the advent of better weather,
and the acts went off with a snap that had been
absent during the wet spell.</p>

<p>“Now, Jack, show ’em what you can do,” advised
Sam Kyle, as it came the turn of the clowns
to enter the ring. “Make a good flight.”</p>

<p>Jack excelled himself, for he had added a new
turn to his stunt, and this was the first time he tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
it. This was to take with him, in a cage concealed
on top of the muslin bag, a tame rooster that belonged
to one of the clowns, who had temporarily
given up using it, as he had a new act.</p>

<p>Chanticleer was put in a cage, and the sides of it
were covered with white muslin, arranged on a
frame work so that they would fall down when a
spring was released, revealing the rooster on top of
the airship. Until the sides fell down, however, it
merely looked like a small square box on top of
the distended muslin bag. Jack could bring the
rooster into view by pulling on a cord.</p>

<p>Jack’s act was getting to be quite complicated.
In addition to jumping off a high platform, he had
to operate the wings of his machine with his feet,
and just as he reached the ground he had to pull
a cord that shot off a blank cartridge and allowed
the balloon to seemingly fall apart, yank another
that displayed the two United States flags, and now
there was a third one, that would release the
rooster.</p>

<p>The bird had been trained to fly, flap its wings
and crow as soon as the sides of its cage fell, and
Jack counted on making quite a hit this time.</p>

<p>He succeeded. Everything went off well, from
the time he jumped with his apparatus off the
tower platform until he shot off the cartridge, unfurling
the flags and revealing the rooster, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
added not a little to the novelty of the act by crowing
most vigorously.</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum! Not so bad! Not so bad! Not
half bad!” was all Mr. Paine said, when he saw
Jack’s latest performance; but the young clown
knew that was the highest praise the manager ever
bestowed.</p>

<p>“If it goes off as well to-night as it did this afternoon,
you’ll get two dollars more a week,” went
on Mr. Paine. “I like my clowns to think up new
things. It’s a wonder some of you fellows
wouldn’t put a little more ginger into your work,”
the manager continued to Jack’s fellow workers.
“Some of you are all right, but unless the rest of
you wake up, you’ll be looking for other jobs
soon.”</p>

<p>He walked away, and several of the clowns murmured
among themselves. The majority, however,
knew they were all right, for they were continually
improving their acts.</p>

<p>“This is what comes of letting a fresh young kid
get in among older performers,” said Ted Chester.
“I’m going to quit soon if he don’t. He gets all
the attention.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” added two or three others.
“The manager thinks he’s the whole show.”</p>

<p>“If we could queer his act some way maybe it
would take him down a peg,” suggested a tall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
lanky clown, whose specialty was to lead an educated
pig around the ring.</p>

<p>“Say, I’ve got an idea,” whispered Ted. “Come
over here, you fellows.”</p>

<p>The dissatisfied ones were soon whispering
among themselves, but whenever any one came
near them they seemed to be discussing the most
ordinary topics.</p>

<p>That night when Jack went to get his apparatus
ready for his performance, he could not find the
trained rooster, that was kept in a cage in a small
tent with other animals used by the clowns.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Pippo?” Jack asked the clown
who had loaned him the bird.</p>

<p>“Seen Pippo? Why, no. I told you to take
care of him. I hope he isn’t lost.”</p>

<p>“I put him in his cage, in here, just as you told
me to, after the performance this afternoon,” replied
Jack. “Now he’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the lock on the cage has been broken
off,” declared the clown, when he had examined
the small box, which was kept locked between performances.
“I must tell Mr. Paine.”</p>

<p>The manager was wrathful when informed of
what had happened.</p>

<p>“There’s some queer game going on in this
show,” he exclaimed. “If I find out who’s responsible
I’ll discharge him at once. Look around,
Jack, and have some of the men help you. That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
a good part of the act, and I don’t want it spoiled.
Maybe some one hid the rooster for a joke, though
it won’t be very funny for him if I find out who it
was.”</p>

<p>Careful search was made for the rooster, but it
was not to be found. It was getting close to the
time of the performance when the living skeleton
came in from the freak tent.</p>

<p>“Where’s the old man?” he asked Jack, as Mr.
Paine had gone to another part of the dressing-tent.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Why?”</p>

<p>“Because the fat lady has kicked up a row, and
she says she won’t go on exhibition. That’ll queer
the show.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with her?” asked Jack, not
caring particularly, however, as he was anxious
about his own act.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s a rooster under the raised platform
she sits on, and she’s superstitious about
roosters. She’s afraid she’ll have bad luck.”</p>

<p>“A rooster!” cried Jack. “I’ll get it! I’ll bet
it’s the one I’m looking for!”</p>

<p>He ran to the freak tent, the inmates of which
knew nothing of the missing rooster. Lifting up
the canvas side of the raised platform, upon which
sat Madam Rosallie del Norto (stage name, her
real one being Mrs. Susan McGinness), Jack saw
the missing bird. No sooner was the canvas flap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
raised than the rooster began to crow. Doubtless
it imagined it was in the regular cage on top of the
airship, and was waiting for the falling of the
sides.</p>

<p>“Some one stole him out of the cage, and hid
him here,” thought Jack, “and I believe I know
who did it. Well, I haven’t time to do any investigating
now, for I must get ready for my act. But
I’ll tell Mr. Paine afterward.”</p>

<p>Jack did not get a chance to inform the manager,
however, for that night after his act, which
went off successfully, there were hurried preparations
for departure, as there was every indication
of another storm.</p>

<p>The performance was cut short, Mr. Paine
going about the ring, urging the performers to
hasten their acts. Jack only did his turn three
times, instead of four.</p>

<p>“There’s a big thunder storm coming up,” explained
the manager, “and I want to get the people
out of the tent before it breaks. I’m going to cut
out the final concert.”</p>

<p>But, try as he did, the performance took some
time, and when he gave orders to omit the chariot
and other races, there was such objection from the
crowd that he was forced to put them on.</p>

<p>The menagerie tent had been struck, the canvas
and poles being loaded into wagons, and the vehicles
started toward the train. There only remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
up the big tent, and as fast as the performers
finished they packed their costumes in trunks,
which were carted away.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re done,” said Sam to Jack, as the
clowns finished their turns. “Let’s pack up and get
into the car. It’s going to be a bad storm.”</p>

<p>“I thought we had had enough rain,” observed
the boy.</p>

<p>“So did I, but you never can tell much about the
weather this time of year.”</p>

<p>They donned their regular clothes, and, having
packed their trunks, went outside of the dressing-tent.
As they did so the whole western sky seemed
to burst into a sheet of flame. At the same time
there was a loud clap of thunder.</p>

<p>“Here it comes!” cried Sam. “Let’s get inside
the tent.”</p>

<p>No sooner had they gotten under the shelter of
the big canvas than the rain came down in torrents.
The storm suddenly broke in all its fury.</p>

<p>There was incessant lightning, and the thunder
was terribly loud. The wind swayed the big
stretch of tent, and women began to scream in
fright.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a panic in a minute,” said Sam,
looking rather alarmed. “I guess this will end the
show.”</p>

<p>It did, for no one cared to look at the races while
such a storm was in progress. The crowd began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
leaving, and men, at the direction of Mr. Paine
and his assistants, began taking up the board seats,
the rattle and bang of the planks adding to the din
and confusion.</p>

<p>The race horses were hurried out of the tent, so
that if the people made a rush the animals would
not get frightened and break loose among them.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a terrific gust of wind.
Some of the smaller tent poles began swaying dangerously,
for there was a terrible strain on them.</p>

<p>“The tent’s falling down!” cried a foolish man.
“Run, everybody!”</p>

<p>Scores of women screamed, and one or two
fainted. Then that seemed to become epidemic,
and more women fell backward, pale and
trembling.</p>

<p>“It’s all right! It’s all right!” cried Mr. Paine,
trying to quiet the hysterical ones. “There’s no
danger! The tent will not fall!”</p>

<p>But his words had no effect. Louder sounded
the thunder, and faster fell the rain. The tent
seemed swaying more and more, and one of the
smaller and unimportant poles snapping in two
caused a panic-stricken rush of people from its vicinity.</p>

<p>“They’re rushing right against the side of the
tent!” cried Sam. “There’s no way to get out
there, as it’s against a high bank! There’ll be a
lot of women trampled under foot!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Why doesn’t the band play and quiet the
rush?” asked Jack, who had read of such things
being done in theatres when there was a fire panic.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Sam. “Good idea!
Come on, we’ll get over to the band-stand and tell
the leader to strike up a tune. Come on!”</p>

<p>He grasped Jack by the arm and half led, half
dragged him through the press of people, who,
every second, were becoming more and more unmanageable.</p>

<p>“Sit down! Stand still! There’s no danger!”
cried Mr. Paine, but all in vain. No one paid any
attention to him. He even began pushing the people
back, to prevent the rush against the bank of
which Sam had spoken. He was only shoved to
one side. The crowd wanted to get out, and that
in the quickest manner possible.</p>

<p>Just as Jack and Sam got near where the band
was stationed (for the musicians had kept their
places), one of the big centre poles began to sway.</p>

<p>“That’s going to fall,” said Jack, in a low voice,
to the head clown. “It’ll kill a lot of people if it
does!”</p>

<p>“Play! Play!” cried Sam frantically. “Play
for all you’re worth, fellows! It’s the only way to
stop the rush!”</p>

<p>The band leader comprehended. He gave a
signal and the men, who were rather alarmed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
the signs of panic all about them, placed their instruments
in position.</p>

<p>Jack, with horror-stricken eyes, watched the
swaying pole. Others were also looking at it.
One man set up a hoarse shout, and more women
screamed. Then, just as the band struck up a
lively air, Jack saw Ike Landon, the boss canvasman,
and several of his helpers spring from the
centre of the middle ring toward the swaying pole.
Would he be able to catch the slipping ropes in
time, and hold them? The lives of many depended
on him now.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>THE MAD ELEPHANT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Ike was equal to the emergency. With one
motion, he had leaped to the foot of the swaying
pole, which held up a great weight of wet canvas,
and he had grabbed the rope which had slipped on
account of the manner in which the tent swayed.</p>

<p>“Come on, you fellows!” yelled Ike to his men.</p>

<p>They came with a rush. The rope was slipping
from the grasp of the head canvasman, but with
the aid of his sturdy helpers he managed to hold
it. They took a turn about a tent stake driven
deep into the ground, and the fallen pole was held
in place.</p>

<p>“That was a close call,” whispered Sam to Jack.</p>

<p>The boy clown nodded. He had had a glimpse
of the dangers that beset a circus, and he had no
liking for them. Only by a narrow margin had a
terrible tragedy been averted.</p>

<p>But now the band was playing. The crowd, that
had seen the masterful manner in which Ike saved
the pole from falling, was becoming quieter. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
panic was dying away, though the storm was now
fiercer than ever. The big tent withstood the blast,
however, and the maddened throng, being turned
back from rushing at the steep bank, swerved
around and poured out of the main entrance and
into the driving rain.</p>

<p>“Those who wish to remain until after the
shower is over may do so!” shouted Mr. Paine,
when the band had done playing. “We will not
take the tent down for some time yet.”</p>

<p>There were cries of thanks from many who had
no liking for going out and getting drenched.
Many did go, however, for they lived at a distance
and wanted to get home. Others, more nervous,
still had some fear that the tent would fall.</p>

<p>“We can’t do much in this storm, anyhow,” said
the manager to some of his men, who had gathered
near him. “Get the seats out of the way, and
we’ll take the tent down as soon as it stops blowing.
The other stuff can go, and we’ll hold a few cars
for the canvas and rush it through on an extra.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the storm had practically
ceased, and then came the hard work of taking
down a wet tent. You boys who have gone camping,
and been obliged to handle your small tent
when it was soaking wet, have some idea what it
means to handle tons of damp canvas. Yet the
circus men went at it as if it was the easiest thing
in the world, and to such a system had they reduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the work that the tent was down in a short time,
and packed in wagons, ready to run on the flat cars.</p>

<p>Jack and Sam, when they saw that the danger
was over, had gone to the train, and, with the other
performers, were soon being whirled to the next
town where the show was to give an exhibition.</p>

<p>“Well, this is something like weather,” remarked
Sam the next morning, as he peered out of
the sleeping-car window. The sun was shining
brightly and the air was soft and warm. There
was scarcely a trace of yesterday’s storm, though
this town was but thirty miles from the one where
the tent had so nearly fallen.</p>

<p>“I dreamed I was being smothered under a lot
of canvas coverings,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I nearly was, once,” declared Sam simply.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Just like last night. Tent blew down in a tornado,
and the whole show, and a big crowd, was
caught. Pole hit me on the head, and I lay there
unconscious and slowly smothering. They got me
out in time, but fifteen people were killed.”</p>

<p>“This is a more dangerous life than I thought,”
mused Jack.</p>

<p>“Dangerous? I guess it is. Folks on the outside
don’t know anything about it. They think being
in a circus is fun. I wish some of them had about
six months of it.”</p>

<p>The performances that afternoon and evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
went off well, and for a week after that the circus
played in good weather. The show was gradually
working back east, and as there had been big
crowds, and no mishaps to speak of, every one was
in good humor.</p>

<p>Jack had no further trouble with the ugly ringmaster
and Ted Chester, and his act was now
looked upon as one of the most “drawing” features
of the show. Mr. Paine promised the lad if he
would stay with him the next season that he would
pay our hero twenty-five dollars a week.</p>

<p>Jack did not know what to do. He had quite a
sum saved up, but not enough to go to China with,
and yet he desired to go and seek his parents. He
disliked to do as Sam had suggested, and appeal
to the professor, although he felt that it might be
the best plan. If no news had been received from
China, Jack made up his mind he would remain
with the circus for another summer, but there was
one difficulty in the way.</p>

<p>The show had no winter season, and Jack would
be out of a job until next spring. He would have
to live in the meantime, and, unless he could get a
place in some theatre, which was doubtful, all his
savings might go to support him while the show
was in winter quarters. It was a harder problem
to solve than he had any idea of, and he decided
he would talk with Sam about it.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ll do,” Jack decided one day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
after the afternoon performance had come to a
close. “I’ll ask him what he would do.”</p>

<p>Sam was not in the dressing-tent, and on inquiring
where he was Jack was told that his friend was
in the animal tent talking to one of the trainers.
Thither the boy clown went.</p>

<p>As he passed the roped-off enclosure where the
elephants were chained to heavy stakes, Jack saw
Bill Henyon, the trainer of the huge beasts, rather
carefully regarding Ajax, the largest tusker in the
herd.</p>

<p>“Going to put him through some new tricks,
Mr. Henyon?” asked Jack, for he had made
friends with the elephant trainer. The man shook
his head.</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong with Ajax,” he said. “I
don’t like the way he’s acting. He’s ugly with
me, and he never was that way before. I’m afraid
I’m going to have trouble. He acts to me as if he
was going to have a mad spell.”</p>

<p>“Do elephants get mad?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, not in the way dogs do, but there comes
a certain time when they get off their feed, or when
they have distemper or something like that, and
then they go off in a rage, destroying everything
they come up against. When an elephant gets that
way in the wild state they call him a ‘rogue,’ and
even the best hunters steer clear of him. He’s a
solitary brute, that kills for the love of killing.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Do you think Ajax will get that way?”</p>

<p>“I hope not, yet I don’t like the way he’s behaving.
I think I’ll double shackle him.”</p>

<p>Jack passed on, glad that it was not his duty to
take charge of the big ungainly brutes. Mr. Henyon
proceeded to fasten Ajax to the ground with
heavy chains about the animal’s feet.</p>

<p>“Now if you want to go off on a tantrum, you’ll
have hard work getting away,” remarked the elephant
man.</p>

<p>Ajax looked at his keeper with his wicked little
eyes, and, lifting up his trunk, gave a shrill trumpet.
Nor was the animal trainer’s mind made any
more easy as he noticed that Ajax was not doing
his accustomed swaying motion, which all those
big beasts, at least in captivity, seem to be always
doing. Clearly something was wrong with Ajax.</p>

<p>Jack found Sam, and had a long talk with his
friend. The head clown again advised the boy
to write to the professor, and see if any news had
come from the boy’s folks.</p>

<p>“If they’re still somewhere in China,” said Sam,
“you had better stick with the show. Maybe I can
help you get a place in some theatre this winter.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll do as you say,” agreed Jack.
“I’ll write to-morrow. But now I’ve got to go and
fix some things on my airship. I broke a hoop in
the bag this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Jack started for the property tent, and he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
scarcely reached it when, from the menagerie,
there came such a terrifying yell, mingled with a
trumpet of rage, that every one who heard it stood
still in horror.</p>

<p>“That’s an elephant!” cried Mr. Delafield.
“Something’s gone wrong!”</p>

<p>“Ajax! It must be Ajax!” shouted Jack. “Bill
told me he was acting queer a while ago!”</p>

<p>“Then he’s killed some one,” exclaimed the property
man, as he rushed from his tent. “I know
that yell. I heard one like it once before! Ajax
has killed a man!”</p>

<p>Jack ran out of the tent after Mr. Delafield.
As he got outside he heard the shrill trumpet
again. Then came a rattle of chains, and a side of
the animal tent bulged out.</p>

<p>“Ajax’s loose! Ajax’s loose!” cried a man, and
the next instant the mad elephant, which had
broken the double chains, rushed from the tent,
trunk in the air, trumpeting shrilly, its wicked little
eyes agleam with rage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<small>JACK’S BAD FALL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Behind</span> the big brute came a score of the animal
men, armed with clubs, pitchforks, iron bars
and elephant hooks. But Bill Henyon was not
among them. The elephant trainer—the master
of Ajax—had given that big brute his last command,
for, as they ran, the men from the animal
tent told how the elephant had seized Henyon in
his trunk, and dashed him to the ground, maiming
him so terribly that he was a cripple for life.</p>

<p>But now every man who could be spared from
the circus grounds started to race after the fleeing
elephant. Canvasmen, drivers, trainers, even the
trapeze performers, joined in the hunt, and of
course Jack, Sam, and several of the other clowns
were there.</p>

<p>“If he runs toward town he’ll do a lot of damage,
and maybe kill two or three people before his
rage dies down,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Can’t they catch him in time?” asked Jack.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“It’s a hard question. There, he’s heading for
the creek. Maybe that’ll cool him off.”</p>

<p>The circus tents had been pitched near a small
stream, and toward this the big brute was now
headed, for, heavy as an elephant is, he can outrun
a man for a short distance, and sometimes beat
him in a long race.</p>

<p>Into the water plunged Ajax, filling his trunk
with it and spraying it all about. He took up his
position in the middle of the stream, as if to bid
defiance to his pursuers.</p>

<p>“Go slow now,” cautioned Hank Servdon, who
was the boss animal man. “I’ll keep him engaged
in front, while some of you sneak up behind and
shackle one leg with a long chain.”</p>

<p>It was a risky plan, but it worked. While Hank
slowly approached Ajax from in front, wading out
into the creek, with his elephant hook raised, ready
to catch it in the sensitive trunk of the brute, other
men approached through the water at the rear,
holding in readiness heavy chains. Ajax concentrated
all his attention on Hank, whom he doubtless
hoped to treat as he had served poor Henyon.</p>

<p>“Ajax! Attention! Up! Up!” suddenly cried
Hank, giving the beast the order to stand on his
hind legs. Habit was too much for the brute, enraged
as he was. With a trumpet of protest, he
rose slowly.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p188.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“To bid defiance to his pursuers”<br />
<span class="illoright"><i>Page <a href="#Page_188">188</a></i></span></p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Now, men!” cried Hank, and in a trice two
chains had been slipped about the hind legs. Ajax
was caught before he had gotten into town, but
there was sorrow among the circus folk when they
heard how grievously Bill Henyon was hurt. Ajax
had caught him unawares, as the elephant man
stooped over to adjust one of the chains that the
big creature had pulled loose.</p>

<p>But the show must go on, no matter what happens
to the employees or performers, and when the
news got around that one of the elephants in the
circus had nearly killed his keeper there was a bigger
crowd than usual at the night performance,
every one anxious for a glimpse of Ajax.</p>

<p>The brute had quieted down somewhat, but
there was an extra fence of ropes about his enclosure
in the animal tent, and he was so heavily
shackled with chains that it would have been a
task even beyond his terrible strength to get loose.</p>

<p>Every one in the circus was more or less nervous
that night, and even the veteran performers on the
high wire and on the flying trapeze did not feel
so sure of themselves as usual.</p>

<p>Once, during a particularly long jump clear
across the tent, when one of the trapeze performers
swings loose to catch in the hands of another,
there was a miscalculation, and the performer fell
quite a distance into the net. After that Mr. Paine
called the act off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“It’s too risky,” he said. “I’m afraid something’s
going to happen to-night.”</p>

<p>Perhaps all this got on Jack’s nerves, for,
though he was usually clear headed, he found himself
feeling somewhat nervous as he climbed to the
top of his platform, ready for his first leap with
the flying machine.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” he exclaimed to himself. “What’s
the matter with me, anyhow? I’m thinking too
much of poor Mr. Henyon. Well, here goes,” and
he launched himself down.</p>

<p>He landed safely, amid the laughter of the
crowd at his queer act.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m all right,” he thought. His success
made him more confident, and he did the next
two turns even better than the first. Then came
the last one.</p>

<p>“I’m tired to-night,” thought Jack. “I don’t
feel just like myself. Guess I must be getting
homesick. Oh, but I would like to see dad and
mom again! I wish I was back in Westville, even
if the professor would have me arrested. Well,
here goes for the last turn, and then I’m going to
bed and sleep.”</p>

<p>There was some delay in getting his platform
over to the far side of the tent, where he was to
make his last jump, and it was almost time for the
final races when it was in position.</p>

<p>Jack climbed up, and his airship was hoisted up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
to him. He did his customary song and dance, and
then prepared to give his exhibition of flying. Yet
in spite of the confidence that had come back to
him when he found that he had done the trick
three times successfully, he felt his nervousness returning.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better take a tonic,” he told himself.
“Well, here goes.”</p>

<p>He leaped forward, grasping the handle of the
big umbrella that extended down through the distended
bag. He expected to feel himself buoyed
up as usual by the big Japanese affair, but as his
feet began to work the pedals controlling the
wings, and as he got ready to pull the strings to
fire the shot and display the flags and rooster, he
realized that something was wrong. The umbrella
was not holding him up. In fact, he was falling
swiftly to the ground.</p>

<p>The crowd not understanding that something
was wrong, began to laugh as it always did, but
there was terror in Jack’s heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a ripping sound, and the big
umbrella turned inside out. Jack fell rapidly and
heavily toward the earth, having no support to
break his terrific fall.</p>

<p>As he landed, his hand unconsciously pulled the
strings and the shot was fired, the flags fluttered
out, and the rooster crowed. The crowd yelled
and applauded, but poor Jack felt a pain in his left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
leg as if some one had run a red-hot iron into it.
Then it seemed as if some one had hit him on the
head with a club. The lights, high up on the tent
poles, died away. All became black, and Jack
knew nothing more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>LEFT BEHIND—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jack regained his senses he found himself
in a soft bed, and, as his eyes roved about they
did not encounter the familiar hangings of the
circus sleeping-car. Instead, they saw a room
neatly papered, and at a window hung with white
curtains sat a young lady. Jack stirred uneasily.
Perhaps he was dreaming.</p>

<p>The woman at the window heard him, and came
over to the bed.</p>

<p>“So you’re awake, are you?” she asked pleasantly.
“How do you feel?”</p>

<p>“Rather—sore—and—stiff,” replied Jack slowly.
“What’s—the—matter—with—my leg?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much. It’s broken, that’s all; but
the doctor says it’s a clean break. You’ll soon be
better.”</p>

<p>“My—head——”</p>

<p>“Yes, you got quite a bad blow on the head, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
you’ve been unconscious for several hours, but it’s
nothing serious.”</p>

<p>“Unconscious for several hours?” repeated Jack
more quickly. “Where’s the circus?”</p>

<p>“It’s gone on.”</p>

<p>“Gone on? And—left—me—behind?”</p>

<p>He spoke more slowly, and he felt a queer sensation.
A lump came into his throat. His eyes
felt hot and heavy. Surely he couldn’t be going to
cry? Of course not!</p>

<p>“Left—behind!” he murmured. “They left me
behind!”</p>

<p>“Why, they couldn’t take you with them,” said
the pretty young woman. “You couldn’t stand it
to be moved, you know. But they felt dreadfully
bad at leaving you.”</p>

<p>“Who did?” asked Jack dully.</p>

<p>“Oh, ever so many. There was one big man
with a red tie, Mr. Rain, I think he said his name
was.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Paine. That’s the manager.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, he gave orders that you should
be taken good care of. Then there was a clown,
I guess, for all the paint wasn’t washed off his face
when he came here. He left a lot of addresses for
you, where the show would be.”</p>

<p>“That was Sam Kyle.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and then there was, oh, such a fat lady!
She said she once had a boy just like you, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
made me promise to give you chicken broth every
day. You have a lot of friends in that circus.”</p>

<p>“Where am I?” asked Jack, beginning to feel
a little better at these evidences of care.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re in a room at the hotel, and I’m
a sort of nurse. Mr. Rain—I mean Mr. Paine—engaged
me for you before he left. Now you’re
to be quiet, for the doctor doesn’t want you to get
excited.”</p>

<p>“How long will I have to stay here?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, about a month. But don’t fret.”</p>

<p>“A month? Why, the show will close then,
and I can’t be with it. Who’ll do my act? I must
go!”</p>

<p>He tried to sit up, but the pain in his leg, and the
ache in his head, made him fall back on the pillow.
The nurse gave him some quieting medicine, and
he soon fell asleep. When he awakened he felt
much better, though he was almost heartbroken at
the thought of being left behind. He questioned
the nurse and she told him what had happened.</p>

<p>There had been some flaw in the umbrella he
used, and it had collapsed, letting him fall almost
the entire forty feet to the ground. That he had
not been worse hurt was regarded as very fortunate.
The show had been obliged to go on, but
Mr. Paine had left a goodly sum with the hotel
proprietor for Jack’s board, and had also left a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
note telling the boy that all his savings, including
his salary to the end of the season, would be held
for him, and sent wherever he requested.</p>

<p>So there was nothing for Jack to do but to remain
in bed. How he longed to be with the show,
and performing his act again, even after the accident,
no one but himself knew. He said nothing
about it to the nurse, but there was a great longing
in his heart.</p>

<p>The nurse and the hotel people were kind to
him, but all the while the boy was becoming more
and more homesick. He was worrying and fretting
about his parents, and he had about made up
his mind to write to Professor Klopper. This
fretting did him no good, in fact it increased his
fever.</p>

<p>“That boy has something on his mind more than
merely being left behind by the circus,” said the
doctor to the nurse one day. “If he doesn’t get
quieter he’ll have a relapse, and that will be bad.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can’t find out what it is,” the nurse
said. None of the circus people had told Jack’s
story.</p>

<p>The day after this Jack asked for something to
read, and while the nurse went to get him a book
she handed him a newspaper, published in a town
not far from where Jack lived. He looked at it
idly hoping he might see some item about the circus,
but the show had evidently passed farther on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Then, as he turned the pages, he caught sight of
an item that gave him a sudden start.</p>

<p>For, staring at him, in black type on the white
page, was this notice, dated from Westville, where
he lived:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Information Wanted</span> concerning Jack Allen,
supposed to be with a traveling circus. He left
his home with Professor Klopper under a misapprehension.
Everything is all right. If he sees
this will he please communicate at once with the
undersigned? A reward will be paid for suitable
information of the whereabouts of the boy.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sylvester Allen.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“It’s my father! My father! He’s back from
China!” cried Jack. “Hurrah! Dad’s back!
Hurry, some one! Get me a pen and paper. I’ll
write at once! No, I’ll telegraph! Whoop! Now
I’m all right!”</p>

<p>The nurse came running back into the room.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked. “What has happened?
You must not excite yourself. You will
have a relapse.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I do,” cried Jack. “My father
and mother are back from their trip around the
world. They’re back from China. I must telegraph
them at once.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Here, drink this. It will quiet you,” said the
nurse, thinking Jack was out of his mind.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be quiet! I want to yell and
sing! Dad’s home! So’s mother! I’m all right
now!”</p>

<p>It took him some time to convince the nurse
that he knew what he was talking about, but when
he had showed her the notice in the paper, and
had told his story, she brought him a telegraph
blank, and the happy boy sent a long message to
his father.</p>

<p>How anxiously he waited for the answer! At
last it came:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jack</span>: We will be with you as soon as
possible. Father and mother. The professor is
coming, too.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I don’t know that I want to see the professor,”
mused Jack, “but I guess it must be all right, or
dad wouldn’t bring him.”</p>

<p>Three hours later Jack was being clasped in his
mother’s arms, while Mr. Allen, with moisture in
his eyes, was holding his son’s hand.</p>

<p>“My poor boy!” said his mother. “To think of
you being a clown in a circus!”</p>

<p>“It was bully fun, while it lasted,” said Jack enthusiastically.
“But I guess I’ve had enough of it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
But what happened to you? Why didn’t you
write?”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t, Jack,” replied his father. “We
were detained in a province which was surrounded
by warring Chinese factions, and we couldn’t get
out, nor send any word. When we did, your
mother and I decided we had had enough of traveling
around the world and we started for home.
We got here, after sending word to the professor
that we were coming, but when we arrived we
found that you had run away.”</p>

<p>“Did he—did he tell you what for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jack,” said Professor Klopper, coming
forward awkwardly. “And I want to beg your
pardon. I—I fear I was a bit hasty.”</p>

<p>“Then you know I didn’t steal the cup?” asked
Jack rather coldly.</p>

<p>“No one stole it. It fell down behind my bureau,
and slipped into a hole in the wall where the
plaster was off. I found it not long after you had—er—left
so unceremoniously, and I wished I
could have found you.</p>

<p>“Then when I got word from your folks, and
I managed to learn that you had joined a circus, I
went to the performance, though I do not believe
in such frivolous amusements. But I could not find
you to tell you the good news. I suppose you were
with some other amusement enterprise, Jack?”</p>

<p>“No, I saw you,” replied the boy, laughing now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
“but I kept out of your way. I was afraid you
wanted to arrest me.”</p>

<p>“Poor Jack!” whispered his mother. “You had
a dreadful time!”</p>

<p>“Oh, not so bad,” was the answer. “I earned
about three hundred dollars, and I’ve got most of
it saved up.”</p>

<p>“Three hundred dollars, if put out at six per
cent interest, and compounded, will double itself
in eleven years, three hundred and twenty-seven
days,” remarked the professor thoughtfully. “I
would recommend that you do that with your
money. In less than twelve years you would have
six hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Not for mine,” said Jack, with a laugh. “I’m
going to buy a motorcycle as soon as my leg gets
well. That’s as near flying as I care to go for a
while.”</p>

<p>Jack was taken home as soon as it was practical
to move him, and he and the professor became
pretty good friends afterward, for it was no small
matter for the dictatorial old college teacher to admit,
to a mere boy, that such wisdom as could figure
out the hardest problem in trigonometry could be
wrong when it came to the simple matter of a missing
gold cup.</p>

<p>Jack got his motorcycle, and a beauty it was, for
when he received his money from the circus treasurer
he found it was nearer four hundred than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
three hundred dollars. Part of it he decided to
save.</p>

<p>“Because you know,” said Jack, “I might some
day want to buy a flying machine, and if I put some
money out at interest long enough I can get it.”</p>

<p>With the check that represented his savings
from the circus came a letter from the manager,
stating that whenever he wanted an engagement
he could have one. There were messages from all
his friends, and a pass to the show good forever
at any place where the Bower &amp; Brewster circus
held forth. And Jack often used it, taking with
him some of his boy friends, and renewing acquaintance
with the performers. But there was no
such attraction as a clown in an imitation flying machine,
though Sam Kyle and his fellows cut up some
queer antics in the ring.</p>

<p>But if Jack ever felt any desire to go back to the
circus life, he never told any one about it, for he
had higher ambitions after that than to don a
multi-colored suit and daub his face over with red
and white paint.</p>
